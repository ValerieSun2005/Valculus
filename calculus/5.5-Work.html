<p>
    The concept of <span class="emph">work</span> is fundamental to physics and engineering. 
    It measures how much energy is transferred to an object due to a force applied over some distance. 
    As you push a pencil across a table, or as Earth pushes down on an apple, 
    work is being done. 
    In each case, energy is being added to an object to make it move a certain distance.
    Let's suppose that an object moves along a straight line 
    with time, as modeled by the position function \(s(t).\)
    <span class="emph">Newton's Second Law</span> states that the force \(F\) applied to an object 
    equals the product of its mass \(m\) and acceleration \(a\)—namely, 
    \begin{equation} 
    F = ma = m \derivOrder{s}{t}{2} \pd \label{eq:newton-2}
    \end{equation}
    In the <span class="emph">International System of Units (SI)</span>, 
    \(m\) is measured in kilograms and \(a\) is measured in meters per second squared. 
    Then \(F\) is expressed in kilogram-meters per second squared, 
    a unit we define as the <span class="emph">newton</span> \((\text N).\) 
    Symbolically, \(1 \un N\) \(= 1 \undiv{kg m}{sec}^2.\) 
    The work \(W\) done by a <i>constant</i> force \(F\) over a distance \(d\) is defined by 
    \begin{equation} 
    W = Fd \pd \label{eq:work-uniform}
    \end{equation}
    So if an object is pushed harder or moved farther, then more work is done 
    because greater energy is needed for the motion. 
    The SI unit for work is a newton-meter, which we define as the <span class="emph">joule</span>
    \((\text J).\) Or if force is measured in pounds and distance is measured in feet, 
    then work is expressed in pound-feet \((\text{lb-ft}).\) 
    Work is <i>independent of time</i>; 
    the time required to move an object is irrelevant to how much energy is transferred to it.
</p>

<div class="example-title"> EXAMPLE 1 </div>
<div class="example">
    <div class="example-problem">  
        How much work is done to lift a \(4\)-kilogram box from the floor 
        onto a chair that is \(0.8\) meter high?
        (The acceleration due to gravity is \(g = 9.8\) meters per second squared.)
    </div>
</div>
<button onclick="toggle1()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution1" class="solution">
    The force on the box due to gravity—the <i>weight</i> of the box—is, 
    following \(\eqref{eq:newton-2},\)
    \[F = mg = (4)(9.8) = 39.2 \un N \pd\]
    To lift the box, we must <i>oppose</i> this force 
    by exerting an equal force upward.
    The work we do is therefore, by \(\eqref{eq:work-uniform},\)
    \[W = Fd = (39.2)(0.8) = \boxed{31.36 \un J}\]
    In words, we expend \(31.36 \un J\) of energy to lift the box up onto the chair.
</div>

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Work with Variable Forces</span>
    We use \(\eqref{eq:work-uniform}\) when \(F\) is constant over the distance \(d.\)
    But what is the work if \(F\) isn't uniform? 
    Let's define the object's path to be the positive \(x\)-axis
    from \(x = a\) to \(x = b.\)
    At each \(x,\) suppose that a force \(F(x)\) acts on the object. 
    We split the interval \([a, b]\) into \(n\) subintervals 
    of endpoints \(x_0,\) \(x_1, \dots,\) \(x_n\) 
    and equal width \(\Delta x.\)
    Assuming \(n\) is big (meaning \(\Delta x\) is small), 
    the force \(F(x)\) is almost constant in each subinterval through which the object moves.
    If \(x_i^*\) is a sample point in the general subinterval \([x_{i - 1}, x_i],\)
    then the work done on the object over this subinterval is approximated 
    by \(\eqref{eq:work-uniform}\) to be 
    \[W_i \approx F \par{x_i^*} \Delta x \pd\]
    Hence, the total work \(W\) is approximated by summing the work done over all \(n\) subintervals: 
    \[W \approx \sum_{i = 1}^n F \par{x_i^*} \Delta x \pd\]
    As we make \(n\) larger, we sample more subintervals, 
    in each of which \(F(x)\) changes very little.
    If we let \(n \to \infty,\) then our sum gives the exact value of \(W\)—that is, 
    \[W = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^n F \par{x_i^*} \Delta x \pd\]
    This Riemann sum represents the integral of \(F(x)\) from \(x = a\) to \(x = b,\)
    so we attain
    \begin{equation} 
    W = \int_a^b F(x) \di x \pd \label{eq:work}
    \end{equation}
    We use this formula if the force is expressed as a function of displacement. 
    These models are abundant in physics, as shown by the following examples. 
</p>
<p>
    <span class="text-remark">REMARK</span>
    If the force is constant, then \(\eqref{eq:work}\) becomes 
    \[W = F \int_a^b \di x = F x \intEval_a^b = F(b - a) \cma\]
    where \((b - a)\) is the distance \(d\) moved. 
    This result is a special case that agrees with \(\eqref{eq:work-uniform}.\)
    Accordingly, \(\eqref{eq:work}\) is the <i>more general formula for the work done</i>.

    <span class="label-emph">Springs</span>
    A spring's stiffness is measured by the <span class="emph">spring constant</span>, \(k.\)
    (A stiff spring has a large \(k,\) whereas a loose spring has a small <nobr>\(k.\))</nobr>
    When a spring is at its natural length, it is said to be in <i>equilibrium</i>. 
    But to stretch a spring, a force must be applied. 
    <span class="emph">Hooke's Law</span> states that  
    to keep a spring stretched by a distance \(x\) from equilibrium position,
    we must apply a force of

    (See <a href="#hooke-law">Figure 1</a>.)
    In words, to continue stretching a spring,

    <span class="label-emph">Gases</span>
    A gas is a substance that expands freely and has no fixed shape.
    Examples of common gases are oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane.
    Consider a sample of gas enclosed by a container and sealed above by a piston
    (<a href="#work-gas">Figure 2</a>).
    The gas expands in volume if its temperature is increased, 
    or if more gaseous molecules are added to the container 
    (for example, through a reaction between multiple gases).
    As the gas expands in volume, the piston is pushed outward—a motion that requires work to be done by the gas. 
    We define <span class="emph">pressure</span> \(P\) as force \(F\) per area \(A;\)
    namely, \(P = F/A.\)
    <span class="emph">Boyle's Law</span> states that a gas's pressure varies inversely 
    with its volume \(V.\)
    Mathematically, if \(C\) is a constant of proportionality, then 
    \[P = \frac{C}{V} \pd\]
    The gas therefore exerts a force of 
    \[F = PA = \frac{C}{V} A \pd\]
    When the gas has a volume of \(V_i,\) 
    the work done to expand the piston by a distance \(\Delta x\)
    is approximately
    \[W_i \approx F_i d = \par{\frac{C}{V_i} A} \Delta x 
    = \frac{C}{V_i} \Delta V \pd\]
    Thus, the work done by the gas 
    as its volume increases from \(V_a\) to \(V_b\) is  
    \begin{equation} 
    W = \int_{V_a}^{V_b} \frac{C}{V} \di V \pd \label{eq:work-gas}

        A cable weighs \(400\) pounds and is \(100\) feet long.
        If the cable is anchored vertically to the top of a tall building,

<button onclick="toggle5()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution5" class="solution">
    <p>
        Each portion of the cable is at a different height, 
        meaning different amounts of work are required to lift different parts of the cable. 
        (More work is needed to hoist the bottom part of the cable,
        whereas the top of the cable is closer to the building's top and therefore requires less work to raise.) 
        It is difficult to attain a force function.
        When this occurs, it is a good idea to break the problem up into smaller bits. 
        Our strategy is to consider horizontal segments of the cable and 
        calculate the work needed to lift each one up the building.
        We'll then sum these works to calculate the total work \(W\) needed to 
        lift the entire cable.

    <p>
        We position the \(y\)-axis to face downward
        such that \(y = 0\) is the cable's top end 
        and \(y = 50\) is its bottom end.
        (See <a href="#work-cable">Figure 3</a>.)
        Let's divide \([0, 50]\) into \(n\) subintervals 
        with endpoints \(y_0, y_1,\) \(\dots, y_n\) and equal length \(\Delta y.\)
        In the general subinterval \([y_{i - 1}, y_i],\) 
        let \(y_i^*\) be a sample point. 
        All points in this subinterval are lifted up by roughly the same distance \(y_i^*.\)
        Since the cable weighs \(400 \un{lb}\) and is \(100 \un{ft}\) long,
        its <i>linear density</i> is \(4 \undiv{lb}{ft}.\) 
        The weight of the <nobr>\(i\)th</nobr> part is therefore \(\par{4 \undiv{lb}{ft}} \par{\Delta y \un{ft}}\)
        \(= 4 \Delta y \un{lb}.\)
        We therefore require an upward force of \(4 \Delta y\) to overcome gravity 
        and successfully raise the portion of cable, so the work needed is approximately 
        \[W_i \approx \underbrace{\par{4 \Delta y}}_{\text{force}} \cdot \underbrace{y_i^*}_{\text{distance}} 
        = 4 y_i^* \Delta y \pd\] 
        Hence, the total work \(W\) is given by summing all \(n\) approximations
        and letting \(n \to \infty \col\)
        \[
        \ba 
        W &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^n 4 y_i^* \Delta y = \int_0^{50} 4y \di y \nl

        Let's position the \(y\)-axis to face downward such that \(y = 0\) is the level of the cone's top.
        Then the water extends from \(y = 2\) to \(y = 8.\)
        We split the interval \([2, 8]\) into \(n\) subintervals 
        \(y_0, y_1,\) \(\dots, y_n\) and equal width \(\Delta y.\)
        Let \(y_i^*\) be a sample point in the general subinterval \([y_{i - 1}, y_i].\)
        Consider pumping out the \(i\)th layer, which we approximate to be a cylinder of volume 
        \[V_i \approx \pi r_i^2 \Delta y \pd\]
        By similar triangles (<a href="#work-cone">Figure 4</a>), we see
        \[\frac{r_i}{8 - y_i^*} = \frac{3}{8} \so r_i = \frac{3}{8} \par{8 - y_i^*} \pd\]
        Accordingly, the mass of the <nobr>\(i\)th</nobr> layer is given by this volume multiplied by 
        water's density—that is,
        \[

        \ea

        This layer must overcome the force of gravity, so we require a force of 
        \[F_i = m_i g \approx \frac{1125}{8} (9.8) \pi \par{8 - y_i^*}^2 \Delta y \pd\]
        Since the layer travels up a distance of approximately \(y_i^*,\) 
        the work required to raise it is roughly
        \[W_i \approx F_i y_i^* = \frac{1125}{8} (9.8) \pi y_i^* \par{8 - y_i^*}^2 \Delta y \pd\]
        The total work done to clear the entire tank is given by summing all \(n\)

        <span class="emph">Hooke's Law</span> gives a force function 
        for a spring to be 
        \begin{equation} 
        F(x) = kx \cma \eqlabel{eq:hooke-law}
        \end{equation}
        where \(k\) is the <span class="emph">spring constant</span>
        and \(x\) is the distance from equilibrium. 
        A gas's pressure \(P\) and volume \(V\) are related by 
        <span class="emph">Boyle's Law</span>:
        \[P = \frac{C}{V} \cma\]
        where \(C\) is a constant of proportionality.
        The work done by the gas 
        as its volume increases from \(V_a\) to \(V_b\) is  
        \begin{equation} 
        W = \int_{V_a}^{V_b} \frac{C}{V} \di V \pd \eqlabel{eq:work-gas}
        \end{equation}
