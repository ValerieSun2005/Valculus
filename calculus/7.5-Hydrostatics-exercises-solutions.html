        A ferry ships steel beams, which each weigh \(400\) kilograms 
        and have a surface area of \(4\) square meters. 
        One beam is accidentally dropped into the ocean. 
        At what depth below the ocean's surface does the beam stop sinking;
        that is, how far below the surface does the beam achieve hydrostatic equilibrium?
        (<i>Hint</i>: Hydrostatic equilibrium is achieved when the hydrostatic force 
        equals the beam's weight.)

        The beam's weight pulls it <i>down</i>, 
        but the hydrostatic force pulls it <i>up</i>. 
        These two forces therefore counter each other. 
        At hydrostatic equilibrium, the upward pull from the hydrostatic force 
        equals the beam's weight. 
        The hydrostatic force acting on the beam is 
        \[F = \rho g A h = 1000(9.8)(4) h \pd\]
        Weight is the product of mass and the acceleration due to gravity, 
        so the beam's weight is \(W = 400(9.8).\)
        Equating \(W\) and \(F,\) we get 
        \[400(9.8) = 1000(9.8)(4) h \implies h = \frac{400}{1000(4)} = \boxed{0.1 \un{m}}\]

        It is most convenient to position the \(y\)-axis such that 
        the positive direction is downward.

        The triangle's height is \(\sqrt{4^2 - (4/2)^2}\) \(= \sqrt{12}\) \(= 2 \sqrt 3 \un m.\)
        Let's position the \(y\)-axis to point downward.
        If \(y = 0\) is the water's surface level, 
        then a thin, horizontal approximating rectangle at \(y\)

        By similar triangles, its width \(w(y)\) is given by

        A hexagon has \(720 \degree,\)
        so at each vertex the interior angle is \(120 \degree.\)
        Only the hexagon's bottom half is relevant
        because no water is in the top half.
        This problem is no different from calculating the hydrostatic force 
        on a trapezoid with the same dimensions. 
        A trapezoid has \(360 \degree;\) we note that the top-left 
        and top-right angles equal \(60 \degree.\)
        By geometry, the trapezoid's height is \(4 \sqrt 3 \un{ft}.\)
        (The trapezoid is only filled up to a level of \(1\) foot.) 
        Let's position the \(y\)-axis to face downward, with the water's surface being \(y = 0.\)
        At any \(y\) a thin, horizontal approximating rectangle 
        is a depth of \(h(y) = y\) beneath the surface. 
        Its width is \(w(y) = 8 + 2a,\) where by similar triangles
        \[\frac{a}{4 \sqrt 3 - y} = \frac{4}{4 \sqrt 3} \implies a = 4 - \frac{y}{\sqrt 3} \pd\]
        So 
        \[w(y) = 8 + 2 \par{4 - \frac{y}{\sqrt 3}} = 16 - \frac{2y}{\sqrt 3} \pd\]
        The water is bounded between the lines \(y = 0\) and \(y = 1;\)
        the hydrostatic force is therefore 
        \[
        \ba

        Its depth from the surface is \(h(y) = y,\)

        Let's position the \(x\)- and \(y\)-axes such that the origin is 
        the circle's center. 
        The equation for a circle of radius \(9\)
        centered at \((0, 0)\) is \(x^2 + y^2 = 81.\)
        Then a thin, horizontal approximating rectangle at \(y\)

        The hydrostatic force acting on the circle is therefore 
        \[

        This rhombus has a height of \(7 \sqrt 2 \un{m}.\)
        Let's position the \(y\)-axis on the rhombus's vertical axis of symmetry; 
        we let it face downward such that \(y = 0\) is the water's surface.
        The rhombus is therefore bounded between the lines \(y = 5\)
        and \(y = 5 + 7 \sqrt 2.\)
        Let's split the rhombus at the line \(y = 5 + 7 \sqrt 2/2,\)
        its horizontal axis of symmetry. 
        We need to consider the hydrostatic force on the top and bottom halves of the rhombus. 
        In the top half, a horizontal approximating rectangle has width (by similar triangles)
        \[\frac{w_1(y)}{y - 5} = \frac{7 \sqrt 2}{\dfrac{7 \sqrt 2}{2}} \implies w_1(y) = 2(y - 5) = 2y - 10 \pd\]
        Conversely, in the bottom half a horizontal approximating rectangle has width 
        (by similar triangles)
        \[\frac{w_2(y)}{5 + 7 \sqrt 2 - y} = \frac{7 \sqrt 2}{\dfrac{7 \sqrt 2}{2}} 
        \implies w_2(y) = 2 \par{5 + 7 \sqrt 2 - y} = 10 + 14 \sqrt 2 - 2y \pd\]
        The depth to <i>any</i> thin, horizontal approximating rectangle at \(y\) is simply \(h(y) = y.\)
        The hydrostatic force on the rhombus's top half is therefore given by 
        \[
        \ba 
        F_1 &amp;= 98000 \int_5^{5 + 7 \sqrt 2/2} y w_1(y) \di y \nl 
        &amp;= 98000 \int_5^{5 + 7 \sqrt 2/2} y (2y - 10) \di y \nl 
        &amp;\approx 1.993 \times 10^7 \un{N} \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        Likewise, the hydrostatic force on the rhombus's bottom half is given by 
        \[
        \ba 
        F_2 &amp;= 98000 \int_{5 + 7 \sqrt 2/2}^{5 + 7 \sqrt 2} y w_2(y) \di y \nl 
        &amp;= 98000 \int_{5 + 7 \sqrt 2/2}^{5 + 7 \sqrt 2} y \par{10 + 14 \sqrt 2 - 2y} \di y \nl 
        &amp;\approx 2.785 \times 10^7 \un{N} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        (Observe that \(F_2 \gt F_1\) because more water is above the bottom half, meaning 
        it experiences a greater hydrostatic force.)
        Accordingly, the total hydrostatic force on the rhombus is 
        \[F = F_1 + F_2 \approx 1.993 \times 10^7 + 2.785 \times 10^7 = \boxed{4.778 \times 10^7 \un{N}}\]

        Since water has a density of \(62.5 \undiv{lb}{ft}^3,\)
        the hydrostatic force on dam A is 
        \[F_A = 62.5 \int_a^b h(y) w(y) \di y \pd\]
        (The integrand and bounds are irrelevant.)
        Conversely, because mercury has a density of \(842.8 \undiv{lb}{ft}^3,\) 
        the hydrostatic force on dam B is 
        \[F_B = 842.8 \int_a^b h(y) w(y) \di y \pd\]
        Because both dams are identical and filled to the same level, 
        the quantities \(h(y),\) \(w(y),\) and \(a\) and \(b\) are the same 
        for both \(F_A\) and \(F_B.\)
        Accordingly, we see

        \frac{F_B}{F_A} = \frac{\ds 842.8 \int_a^b h(y) w(y) \di y}{\ds 62.5 \int_a^b h(y) w(y) \di y}
        = \frac{842.8}{62.5} = 13.5 \pd

        Then \(F_B = 13.5 F_A,\) meaning dam B experiences \(13.5\) times 
        more force than dam A does.
        This result shows how heavy mercury truly is!

        So \(F\) does not depend on \(m.\)
        Accordingly, the hydrostatic force against the rectangle is independent of \(m.\)

        A parabolic cup is \(5\) inches tall, 
        and its base extends \(3\) inches from the center of the cup's base. 
        Calculate the hydrostatic force acting against the cup 
        when it is completely filled with milk, whose density is roughly \(64.3 \undiv{lb}{ft}^3.\)

        Let's define a coordinate system such that the origin is at the bottom-center 
        of the cup's cross section.
        We model this parabola using \(y = ax^2,\) where 
        \[a = \frac{y}{x^2} = \frac{5}{3^2} = \frac{5}{9} \pd\]
        In addition, the top of the cup—that is, the surface level of the milk—is the line \(y = 5.\)
        A thin, horizontal approximating rectangle to the cup is therefore a depth of \(h(y) = 5 - y\)
        below the surface. 
        Its width is \(2x,\) where 
        \[x = \sqrt{\frac{y}{a}} = \sqrt{\frac{y}{5/9}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt 5} y \pd\]
        Instead of using \(\delta = 62.5,\) as for water, we use \(\delta = 64.3.\)
        Doing so, we calculate the hydrostatic force to be 
        \[
        \ba 
        F &amp;= 64.3 \int_0^5 (5 - y) \cdot 2 \par{\frac{3}{\sqrt 5} y} \di y \nl 
        &amp;= 64.3 \cdot \frac{6}{\sqrt 5} \par{\frac{5y^2}{2} - \frac{y^3}{3}} \intEval_0^5 \nl 
        &amp;\approx \boxed{3594.479 \un{lb}}

<!-- [[[HARD]]] -->
        Nonuniform liquid is poured into a box whose height is \(4\) feet. 
        The fluid's density increases linearly with depth; 
        the density is \(70 \undiv{lb}{ft}^3\) at the surface 
        and \(150 \undiv{lb}{ft}^3\) at the bottom.
        A rectangle of width \(6\) feet and height \(3\) feet
        is submerged such that its top side is \(2\) feet beneath the surface.
        Calculate the hydrostatic force against this rectangle.

        At any \(y,\) a row of the rectangle is a height of \(h(y) = y\)
        beneath the water's surface. 
        The rectangle has a uniform width of \(w(y) = 6\)
        and is bounded between the lines \(y = 2\) and \(y = 2 + 3\) = \(5.\)
        The density is <i>not</i> constant, 
        so in the integrand we must include a function \(\rho(y)\)—the density 
        of the fluid at some depth \(y\) below the surface. 
        As given, \(\rho(y)\) increases linearly 
        such that \(\rho(0) = 70\) and \(\rho(4) = 150.\)
        So we model 
        \[\rho(y) = 70 + \par{\frac{150 - 70}{4}} y = 70 + 20 y \pd \]
        Hence, the hydrostatic force acting upon the rectangle is 
        \[
        \ba 
        F &amp;= \int_2^5 \rho(y) h(y) w(y) \di y \nl
        &amp;= \int_2^5 (70 + 20 y) y \cdot 6 \di y \nl 
        &amp;= \par{210 y^2 + 40 y^3} \intEval_2^5 
        = \boxed{9090 \un{lb}}
        \ea
