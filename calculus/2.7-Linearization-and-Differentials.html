    When we first introduced derivatives in Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/2.1-Defining-a-Derivative.html">2.1</a>, 
    we declined to elaborate on <b>differentials</b>.
    In Section 
    <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/2.2-Differentiating-Power,-Exponential,-and-Sinusoidal-Functions.html">2.2</a>, 
    we wrote equations of tangent lines. 
    In this section we use tangent lines to <i>approximate</i> a function's outputs. 
    We also define differentials and provide applications 
    for them, including how they are connected to tangent lines.

<p>
    When we have a complicated function, it could be difficult to compute its outputs explicitly. 
    But we can use calculus to approximate its values by using a line. 
    The best <i>linear approximation</i> of a function is its tangent line.
    This process is called <span class="emph">linearization</span>—the procedure of estimating 
    a function's values by using the outputs of its tangent line.
    In other words, we approximate a curve to be its tangent line.
    Suppose that a line is tangent to the curve \(f\) at the point \(P(a, f(a)).\)
    Let \(T(x)\) be the function that represents this tangent line.
    In Section 
    <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/2.2-Differentiating-Power,-Exponential,-and-Sinusoidal-Functions.html">2.2</a>
    we asserted that an equation of this tangent line is 
    \[y - f(a) = f'(a) (x - a) \pd\]
    Replacing \(y\) with \(T(x)\) gives 
    \[T(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) \pd\]
    We take \(T(x)\) to estimate \(f(x),\) so we use 
    \begin{equation} 
    f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a) (x - a) \pd \label{eq:f-approx}
    \end{equation}
    <a href="#deriv-linear-approximation">Figure 1</a>
    shows the line tangent to the curve \(f\) at the point \(P(a, f(a)).\)
    The point \((x, T(x))\) on the line approximates \((x, f(x)).\)
    We say the linearization of \(f(x)\) is <b>centered at</b> \(x = a\)
    because we use this point as a reference for the approximation; note that \(T(a) = f(a).\) 
    In this estimate, we are assuming that \(f\) <i>changes consistently at the same rate</i> \(f'(a).\)
    This approximation for \(f\) is effective for \(x\) near the <i>point of tangency</i>, point \(P,\)
    because zooming in on the curve \(f\) near \(P\) reveals a resemblance to a line. 
    But this approximation often diminishes in accuracy for \(x\) far away from \(P.\)

        <span class="label-emph">Equation of Tangent Line</span>
        To calculate the slope to \(y = \sqrt x\) when \(x = 9,\) 
        we differentiate \(\sqrt x = x^{1/2}\) using the Power Rule:
        \[\deriv{}{x} \par{x^{1/2}} = \tfrac{1}{2} x^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt x} \pd\]
        Hence, the slope when \(x = 9\) is 
        \[\frac{1}{2 \sqrt 9} = \frac{1}{6} \pd\]
        The point of tangency is \((9, 3),\)
        so an equation of the tangent line is 
        \[y - 3 = \tfrac{1}{6} (x - 9) \or \boxed{y = 3 + \tfrac{1}{6} (x - 9)}\]

        <span class="label-emph">Approximation</span>
        The tangent line \(y = 3 + \tfrac{1}{6} (x - 9)\) is the best linear approximation to 
        \(y = \sqrt x\) for \(x\) near \(9.\)
        We estimate \(\sqrt{10}\) as the output of this tangent line when \(x = 10.\)
        Substituting \(x = 10\) into the equation of the tangent line, we see 
        \[\sqrt{10} \approx 3 + \tfrac{1}{6}(10 - 9) = \boxed{\tfrac{19}{6}} \approx 3.167 \pd\]
        The actual value of \(\sqrt{10}\) is approximately \(3.162.\)
        Our approximation of \(3.167\) is very accurate! 
        Since \(x = 10\) is close to the <b>center</b> of the approximation, \(a = 9,\)
        the tangent line is an excellent estimate for the value of \(\sqrt x.\)
        (See <a href="#deriv-linear-sqrt10">Figure 3</a>.)
        Using tangent lines allows you to estimate values of square roots in your head—a 
        great trick.

        <span class="label-emph">Equation of Tangent Line</span>
        The derivative of \(\sin x\) is \(\cos x,\) 
        so the slope to the curve \(y = \sin x\) at \(x = 2 \pi/3\) is 
        \[\cos \tfrac{2 \pi}{3} = -\tfrac{1}{2} \pd\]
        When \(x = 2 \pi/3,\)
        \[y = \sin \tfrac{2 \pi}{3} = \tfrac{\sqrt 3}{2} \pd\]
        Thus, an equation of the tangent line is
        \[y - \tfrac{\sqrt 3}{2} = -\tfrac{1}{2} \par{x - \tfrac{2 \pi}{3}}

        We approximate \(\sin 3\) as the \(y\)-value the tangent line

        \[\sin 3 \approx -\tfrac{1}{2} (3) + \tfrac{\pi}{3} + \tfrac{\sqrt 3}{2} \approx \boxed{0.413}\]
        Unfortunately, the actual value of \(\sin 3\) turns out to be roughly \(0.141.\)
        Our estimate \(0.413\) is not very accurate because \(x = 3\) is 
        relatively far away from the <b>center</b> of the linearization, \(x = 2 \pi/3.\)

    Until now, we have postponed the interpretation of the <b>differentials</b> 
    \(\dd x\) and \(\dd y\) in the equation \(\textDeriv{y}{x} = f'(x).\) 
    Multiplying both sides by \(\dd x\) shows 
    \begin{equation} 
    \dd y = f'(x) \di x \pd \label{eq:dy-dx}
    \end{equation}
    In this form, we interpret \(\dd x\) as an <i>independent variable</i> whose value 
    we are free to select. 
    Then \(\dd y\) is a corresponding dependent variable whose value depends on \(x\) and \(\dd x.\)
    Notice that little values of \(\dd x\) yield small outputs \(\dd y,\)
    whereas large values of \(\dd x\) force \(\dd y\) to be more substantial.

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Interpreting Differentials Geometrically</span>
    Differentials model the slope of a tangent line.
    In <a href="#differential-graph">Figure 5</a>, the points \(P(x, f(x))\)
    and \(Q(x + \Delta x, f(x + \Delta x))\) are marked on the graph of \(f.\) 
    The line tangent to \(f\) at \(P\) is drawn.
    Segment \(\segment{PS}\) is the change in \(x\) over the interval 
    \([x, x + \Delta x];\) we take \(\Delta x = \dd x.\)
    Observe that the change in the \(y\)-value of \(f\) over \([x, x + \Delta x]\) is given by 
    \[\Delta y = f(x + \Delta x) - f(x) = \length{QS} \pd\]
    Over the interval \([x, x + \Delta x],\) the tangent line rises by a height \(\segment{RS}.\)
    Since this tangent line has slope \(f'(x),\)
    its rise \(\length{RS}\) is given by 
    \begin{equation} 
    \dd y = f'(x) \di x \pd \eqlabel{eq:dy-dx}
    \end{equation}
    Thus, \(\dd y\) is the amount by which the <i>tangent line rises or falls</i>, whereas 
    \(\Delta y\) measures the amount by which the <i>curve \(f\) rises or falls</i>. 
    As an example, in <a href="#deriv-linear-approximation">Figure 1</a> 
    over the interval \([a, x],\) the curve \(f\) falls but the tangent line rises; 
    hence, \(\Delta y \lt 0\) but \(\dd y \gt 0.\)
    As \(\dd x\) is made smaller, the approximation \(\Delta y = \dd y\) increases in accuracy; that is, 
    the amount by which the tangent line rises or falls follows the 
    amount risen or fallen by the curve.
    Therefore, we often think of \(\dd x\) and \(\dd y\) as <i>infinitely small quantities</i>—such that 
    the curve behaves identically to its tangent line. 
    Doing so enables us to approximate values of \(f\) (which could be difficult to obtain) as the values of its tangent line.
</p>
<p>
    If we desire, then we can use \(\eqref{eq:dy-dx}\) as a linear approximation. 
    In fact, \(\eqref{eq:dy-dx}\) is an alternate representation of \(\eqref{eq:f-approx},\) 
    as shown by the following algebra:
    Taking \(\dd y \approx \Delta y\) and \(\dd x = \Delta x,\) \(\eqref{eq:dy-dx}\) becomes   
    \begin{flalign}
    &&\Delta y &\approx f'(x) \Delta x \nonumber &\nl
    \laWord{or} && f(x) - f(a) &\approx f'(x)(x - a) \nonumber &\nl 
    \laWord{so} && f(x) &\approx f(a) + f'(x) (x - a) \pd \eqlabel{eq:f-approx}
    \end{flalign}
    Thus, differentials present another (yet equivalent) perspective to linear approximations.

        Therefore, the differential \(\dd y\) is given by 
        \begin{equation} 
        \dd y = x \di x \pd \label{eq:dy-ex}

        Let \(r\) be the sphere's radius and \(V\) be its volume. 
        Then \(V = \tfrac{4}{3} \pi r^3.\)
        We take the maximum measurement error of \(r\) to be \(\Delta r = \dd r.\)
        Likewise, the error in \(V\) is \(\Delta V,\) as approximated by
        \[\dd V = 4 \pi r^2 \di r \pd\]
        For \(r = 14\) and \(\dd r = 0.07,\) we 
        estimate the maximum error in the sphere's volume to be 
        \[\dd V = 4 \pi(14)^2 (0.07) \approx \boxed{172.411 \un{cm}^3}\]
    </p>
    <aside class="box-remark">
        Note that 
        \[
        \frac{\dd V}{V} = \frac{4 \pi r^2 \di r}{\tfrac{4}{3} \pi r^3} = \frac{3 \di r}{r} \pd
        \]
        Hence, the relative error of the volume is three times the percent error of the radius.
    </aside>
    <p>
        <span class="label-emph">Percent Error</span>
        The <b>relative error</b> 
        is given by the error \(\Delta V\) divided by the measured volume \(V.\)
        The sphere's volume is measured to be 
        \[V = \tfrac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = \tfrac{4}{3} \pi (14)^3 \approx 11494.040 \un{cm}^3 \pd\]
        Hence, the maximum relative error in the measurement is 
        \[
        \frac{\Delta V}{V} \approx \frac{\dd V}{V} = \frac{172.411}{11494.040} \approx 0.015 \pd
        \]
        This <i>relative error</i> is equivalent to a <b>percent error</b> of \(\boxed{1.500\%}.\)

    <div class="example-problem">  
        Use differentials to approximate the amount by which a cube's volume decreases 
        when all its sides are shrunk from \(2\) inches to \(1.9\) inches.
    </div>
</div>
<button onclick="toggle7()" class="solution-button">  </button>
<div id="solution7" class="solution">
    Let \(V\) be the cube's volume and \(s\) be the length of one side.
    Then \(V = s^3.\)
    The length of one side changes by \(\dd s = -0.1,\)
    so we see  
    \[\dd V = 3s^2 \di s = 3(2)^2(-0.1) = -1.2 \un{in}^3 \pd\]
    (This result is negative because the volume has <i>decreased</i>.)
    So the volume has <i>shrunk</i> by \(\boxed{1.2 \un{in}^3}.\)
    The actual amount by which the cube's volume changes is 
    \[\Delta V = \tfrac{4}{3} \pi (1.9 - 2)^3 \approx -1.141 \un{in}^3 \cma\]
    so our differential \(\dd V = -1.2\) is close. 
    With calculators, using differentials seems pointless—but what if you 
    needed to perform estimations in your head?

        <a href="#linearization" class="summary-anchor">Linearization</a>
        We use <span class="emph">linearization</span> to approximate a function's values 
        by constructing a tangent line.
        If \(f\) is differentiable at \(a,\) then we form a tangent line to \(f\) 
        at \(a\) (the <span class="emph">center</span> of the approximation).
        Then we approximate \(f(x)\) by 
        evaluating its tangent line at \(x \col\)
        \begin{equation} 
        f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a) (x - a) \pd \eqlabel{eq:f-approx}
        \end{equation}
        The right-hand side is the output of the tangent line at \(x.\)
        Linearization is most effective for \(x\) close to \(a.\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#differentials" class="summary-anchor">Differentials</a>
        If \(y = f(x)\) and \(f\) is differentiable, then 
        the <b>differential</b> \(\dd y\) is given by
        \begin{equation} 
        \dd y = f'(x) \di x \pd \eqlabel{eq:dy-dx}
        \end{equation}
        Geometrically, \(\dd y\) is the amount by which the tangent line to \(f\)
        at \(x\) rises or falls as \(x\) is increased by \(\dd x.\)
        Differentials present another way to conduct linear approximations
        and are useful to estimate the maximum errors of measurements.
