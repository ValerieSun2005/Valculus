        The first step to solving a work problem 
        is to define an axis system. 
        It is easiest to let the \(y\)-axis face straight downward such that \(y = 0\)
        is the level of the cone's top vertex.
        Then the water is bounded between the lines \(y = 3\)
        and \(y = 10.\)
        Consider a thin layer of water of height \(\Delta y\) 
        located a depth of \(y\) beneath the top. 
        (The layer is therefore a distance of \(10 - y\) above the bottom.)
        The layer is approximated by a disk of volume  
        \[\Delta V = \pi r^2 \Delta y \cma\]
        where by similar triangles 
        \[\frac{r}{y} = \frac{4}{10} \implies r = \frac{2}{5} y \pd\]
        The disk's volume is therefore 
        \[\Delta V = \pi \par{\frac{2}{5} y}^2 \Delta y 
        = \frac{4}{25} \pi y^2 \Delta y \pd \] 
        Its weight is therefore 
        \[62.5 \cdot \frac{4}{25} \pi y^2 \Delta y = 10 \pi y^2 \Delta y \pd\] 
        To effectively pump the disk to the top,
        we require an upward force equal to the weight,
        maintained over a distance of \(y.\)
        The work done in pumping out this layer is then approximated by
        \[\Delta W = y \par{10 \pi y^2 \Delta y} = 10 \pi y^3 \Delta y \pd\]
        Hence, the total work required to pump out all the water is 
        \[

                The \(20 \muUnit C\) needs to be moved from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 3.\)
                Since this positive particle is attracted to the negative particle,

                (The sign of \(F\) is therefore negative.)
                Initially, the negative particle is \(4 \un m\) right of the positive particle;

        In the Rutherford–Bohr model for the hydrogen atom, an electron undergoes a circular orbit of radius \(R\)
        around a stationary proton (<a href="#work-hydrogen-atom-ex">Figure 6</a>). 
        When the hydrogen atom absorbs a photon, the atom's total energy increases 
        and the electron jumps to a higher energy level, 
        meaning its orbit increases in radius.
        Using Coulomb's Law in terms of \(R,\) 
        calculate the energy needed to move the electron farther out to an orbit of radius \(2R.\)
        (A proton has a charge of \(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\) \(\un C,\)

        The electron is attracted to the center proton, 
        so the electron experiences a force <i>toward</i> the center. 
        To move the electron farther away (to a larger orbit), we must apply an equal 
        force radially outward. 
        By Coulomb's Law, at some distance \(r\) we must apply an outward force equal to 
        \[F = \frac{\par{9.0 \times 10^9} \par{1.6 \times 10^{-19}}^2}{r^2} = \frac{2.304 \times 10^{-28}}{r^2} \pd\]
        We integrate along the electron's path—namely, from \(r = R\) to \(r = 2R.\)
        The energy needed equals the work done by the electrostatic force, 
        which we calculate in joules to be
        \[

        Let \(y = 0\) be the top of the cable, and let \(y = 400\)

        Since the cable weighs \(800 \un{lb}\) and is \(400 \un{ft}\) long, 
        its linear density is \(2 \undiv{lb}{ft}.\)
        Consider a segment of cable of vertical length \(\Delta y.\)

        A cord weighs \(0.15\) pound and is \(0.5\) foot long.  
        Initially slack, it is pulled upward and fully extended vertically. 
        Calculate the work required to raise the cord up to its full length.

        It is easiest to let \(y = 0\) be the top of the cord and let \(y = 0.5\)
        be the bottom of the cord.
        Because the cord weighs \(0.15 \un{lb}\) and is \(0.5 \un{ft}\) long, 
        the linear density is \(0.3 \undiv{lb}{ft}.\)
        Consider a segment of cord of vertical length \(\Delta y.\)
        The weight of the segment is therefore \(0.3 \Delta y \un{lb}.\)
        To successfully pull up the portion of cord, 
        a force of \(0.3 \Delta y \un{lb}\) must be applied upward to counter the downward force of gravity.
        Since the segment is lifted a distance of approximately \(y,\)
        the work we require is 
        \[\Delta W \approx \underbrace{0.3 \Delta y}_{\text{force}} \cdot \underbrace{y}_{\text{distance}} 
        = 0.3 y \Delta y \pd\]
        The total work in raising the cord is therefore 
        \[
        \ba 
        W &amp;= \int_0^{0.5} 0.3 y \di y = \frac{0.3y^2}{2} \intEval_0^{0.5} \nl 
        &amp;= \boxed{0.0375 \un{ft-lb}}

        Work is done to stretch a spring by a distance of \(d\) past its natural length. 
        What multiple of this work is needed to stretch the spring from a distance of \(d\)
        to a distance of \(2d\) past its natural length?

        The work needed to stretch the spring from \(x = 0\) (equilibrium position)
        to \(x = d\) is 
        \[W_1 = \int_0^d kx \di x = \tfrac{1}{2} kx^2 \intEval_0^d = \tfrac{1}{2} kd^2 \pd\]
        To stretch the spring from \(x = d\) to \(x = 2d,\) 
        we require a work of 
        \[W_2 = \int_d^{2d} kx \di x = \tfrac{1}{2} kx^2 \intEval_d^{2d} 
        = \tfrac{1}{2} k (2d)^2 - \tfrac{1}{2} kd^2 = \tfrac{3}{2} kd^2 \pd\]
        We therefore see 
        \[\frac{W_2}{W_1} = \frac{\tfrac{3}{2} kd^2}{\tfrac{1}{2} kd^2} = 3 \pd\]
        So \(W_2 = 3 W_1,\) 
        meaning <b>three times more work is required</b> to stretch the spring from \(x = d\) to \(x = 2d.\)

        A container of gas with a volume of \(3\) cubic feet and a pressure of \(12\) pounds per square inch is sealed by a piston.
        A spring whose stiffness is \(k = 150\) pounds per foot is attached to both the container and the piston; 
        the spring is initially in equilibrium. 
        (See <a href="#work-spring-gas-ex">Figure 7</a>.)
        The gas's volume then expands to \(5\) cubic feet.
        Calculate the distance \(d\) the spring stretches.

        Using Boyle's Law with \(V = 3 \un{ft}^3\) and \(P = 12 \un{psi},\) we attain 
        \[12 = \frac{C}{3} \implies C = 36 \pd\]
        The work done by the gas is therefore 
        \[W = \int_3^5 \frac{36}{V} \di V = 36 \ln \abs V \intEval_3^5 = 36 \ln \frac{5}{3} \pd\]
        This quantity is the amount of energy the gas uses to push out the piston;  
        <i>it therefore equals the work done in stretching the spring by a distance \(d.\)</i>
        We express the work done in stretching the spring as 
        \[\int_0^d 150 x \di x = 75 x^2 \intEval_0^d = 75 d^2 \pd\]
        Accordingly, we see 
        \[75 d^2 = 36 \ln \frac{5}{3} \implies d = \sqrt{\frac{36}{75} \ln \frac{5}{3}} \approx \boxed{0.495 \un{ft}}\]
        (Of course, the negative solution for \(d\) is nonsense.)
