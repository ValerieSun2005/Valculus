    We have differentiated functions in the form \(y = f(x)\).
    But sometimes it's impossible to express \(y\) as a function of \(x.\)
    In these cases, we write <i>implicit equations</i> to relate \(x\) and \(y.\)
    The method of <i>implicit differentiation</i> enables us to find slopes to a curve 
    without needing to solve for \(y\) explicitly. 
    We apply implicit differentiation to differentiate inverse functions, which make up
    the remaining functions we have yet to discuss. 
    We cover the following topics:

<h4 id="implicit-diff">Implicit Differentiation</h4>

<p>
    An equation of the form \(y = f(x)\) is called an  
    <span class="emph">explicit equation</span>, examples of which are 
    \(y = x - 4\) and \(y = x^2 - 4x.\)
    Conversely, an <span class="emph">implicit equation</span>
    relates \(x\) and \(y\) through an equation in which \(y\) isn't expressed as a function of \(x.\)
    Examples of implicit equations are 
    \[x^2 + xy = 6 \and 9x - 4y = 0 \pd\]
    <span class="emph">Implicit differentiation</span> is the process by which we obtain 
    \(\textderiv{y}{x}\) by treating \(y\) as a function of \(x\) and applying the Chain Rule 
    (from Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/2.4-Chain-Rule.html">2.4</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Many curves are best expressed as explicit equations.
    For example, the equation of a unit circle is   
    \begin{equation} 
    x^2 + y^2 = 1 \pd \label{eq:unit-circle}
    \end{equation}
    The curve generated by a unit circle contains <i>all the coordinates \((x, y)\)</i>
    for which \(\eqref{eq:unit-circle}\) holds true.
    Writing the implicit equation \(\eqref{eq:unit-circle}\) 
    enables us to represent the entire circle without needing to solve for \(y.\)
    To determine the slope of this circle at any point \((x, y),\)
    we use <b>implicit differentiation</b> to attain \(\textderiv{y}{x} \col\)
    We treat \(y\) as \(y(x),\) a function of \(x,\)
    so \(\eqRef{eq:unit-circle}\) should be thought of as   
    \[x^2 + [y(x)]^2 = 1 \pd\]
    Now we differentiate both sides with respect to \(x,\)
    using the Chain Rule to differentiate \(y(x).\) Doing so gives  
    \[2x + 2y \deriv{y}{x} = 0 \pd\]
    Now we solve for \(\textDeriv{y}{x} \col\)
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = -\frac{x}{y} \pd\]

<p>
    <a href="#implicit-diff-circle">Figure 1</a> shows a diagram of a unit circle with a tangent line.
    At \((0, -1)\) and \((0, 1),\) the circle has horizontal tangents because \(\textderiv{y}{x} = 0.\)
    Conversely, at \((-1, 0)\) and \((1, 0)\) the circle has vertical tangents
    and so \(\textderiv{y}{x} = 0\) is undefined.
    Hence, \(\textDeriv{y}{x} = -x/y\) appears mathematically accurate. 
    Solving for \(y\) in \(\eqref{eq:unit-circle}\) would yield two explicit equations, \(y = f(x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}\)
    and \(y = g(x) = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}.\)
    The graph of \(f\) represents the top half of the unit circle, while the graph of \(g\) represents the bottom half.  
    Indeed, we see
    \[
    \baat{2}
    f'(x) &= \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \lspace g'(x) &&= \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \nl 
    &= \frac{-x}{y} &&= \frac{x}{y} \pd
    \eaat 
    \]  
    These results agree with our result \(\textDeriv{y}{x} = -x/y,\) obtained from implicit differentiation. 
    Note that \(g'(x) = x/y\) is correct because \(y \lt 0.\)
<p>
<p>
    In some cases, we can directly solve for \(y\) in an implicit equation, 
    just as we did with \(\eqref{eq:unit-circle}.\)
    Similar to the unit circle example, 
    the implicit equation \(xy = 1\) can be written explicitly as \(y = 1/x.\)
    Thus, \(\textderiv{y}{x}\) can be found by simply applying the Power Rule—no implicit differentiation needed.
    Yet in most cases, <i>solving for \(y\) explicitly is impossible</i> 
    and implicit differentiation is needed to acquire \(\textderiv{y}{x}.\)
    Let's establish a set of steps to perform implicit differentiation.

        The equation \(-y^2 - 2xy\) \(= 0\) also has the solution \(y = 0.\)

        <span class="label-emph">Horizontal Tangents</span>
        The curve has a <b>horizontal tangent</b> when \(\textderiv{y}{x} = 0.\)
        For an <i>implicit</i> curve, we must describe locations as points—that is, 
        we need both \(x\) and \(y.\)
        In \(\eqref{eq:dy/dx-tangents}\) we observe that \(\textderiv{y}{x} = 0\)
        when the numerator is \(0\) and the denominator is nonzero. 
        So solving shows
        \[-y^2 - 2xy = 0 \implies x = -\tfrac{1}{2} y \pd\]
        Plugging this expression into \(x^2 y = 2 - xy^2,\) we see   
        \[
        \ba 
        \par{-\tfrac{1}{2} y}^2 y &= 2 - \par{-\tfrac{1}{2} y} y^2 \nl

        y^3 &= -8 \nl 
        \implies y &= -2 \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        The \(x\)-coordinate corresponding to \(y = -2\) is \(x = -\tfrac{1}{2}(-2)\)
        \(= 1.\)
        Thus, the curve has a horizontal tangent at the point \(\boxed{(1, -2)}.\)

        <span class="label-emph">Vertical Tangents</span>
        The curve has a <b>vertical tangent</b> when the denominator of \(\textderiv{y}{x}\) 
        is \(0\) and the numerator is nonzero. In \(\eqref{eq:dy/dx-tangents}\) 
        equating \(x^2 + 2xy\) to \(0\) shows 
        \[x(x + 2y) = 0 \implies x = -2y \pd\]
        (We ignore the solution \(x = 0\) because it does not satisfy the implicit equation 
        \(x^2 y = 2 - xy^2.\))
        Substituting \(x = -2y\) into the implicit equation 
        shows 
        \[
        \ba 
        \par{-2y}^2 y &= 2 - (-2y) y^2 \nl 
        2y^3 &= 2 \nl

        Thus, \(x = -2(1) = -2.\)
        So the curve has a vertical tangent at the point

<h4 id="inverse-diff">Differentiating Inverse Functions</h4>
<p>
    A function \(f\) has an <b>inverse function</b> \(\inv f\) if and only if 
    \[f \par{\inv f(x)} = x \or \inv f (f(x)) = x \pd\]
    In other words, composing a function with its inverse function must return the 
    independent variable.
    For example, the functions \(\sin x\) and \(\asin x\) 
    are inverse functions, just as \(2^x\) and \(\log_2 x\) are inverse functions. 
</p>
<p>
    Let \(f\) be an invertible and differentiable function.
    To differentiate its inverse function \(\inv f,\) we apply implicit differentiation to the equation 
    \[f \par{\inv{f} (x)} = x \pd\]
    Our goal is to obtain an expression for \(\par{\inv f}'(x),\)
    the derivative of \(\inv{f} \) with respect to \(x.\)
    Differentiating both sides with respect to \(x\) shows 
    \begin{flalign}
    &&f'\par{\inv f(x)} \cdot \par{\inv f}'(x) &= 1 \nonum &\nl
    \laWord{so} && \par{\inv f}'(x) &= \frac{1}{f'\par{\inv f(x)}} \pd \label{eq:f-inverse-deriv}
    \end{flalign}
    Alternatively, if we let \(y = \inv f(x),\) then we see \(x = f(y)\) and 
    \(\textderiv{x}{y} = f'(y).\)
    Accordingly, \(\eqref{eq:f-inverse-deriv}\) becomes 
    \begin{flalign} 
    &&\par{\inv f}'(x) &= \frac{1}{f'(y)} \nonum &\nl
    \laWord{or} &&\deriv{y}{x} &= \frac{1}{\textderiv{x}{y}} \pd \label{eq:dx/dy}
    \end{flalign}
    Hence, \(\eqref{eq:f-inverse-deriv}\) and \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\) are 
    expressions we can use to differentiate an inverse function. 
    \(\eqrefer{eq:dx/dy}\) is convenient if we can express \(x\) as a function of \(y,\)
    since we obtain a derivative function. 
    Conversely, \(\eqref{eq:f-inverse-deriv}\) can be used to find the derivative of an inverse function 
    at some point. 
    The relationship of \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\) is particularly elegant, 
    since it strengthens the magic of Leibniz's notation 
    in connecting the differentials \(\dd x\) and \(\dd y.\)

    <span class="label-emph">Geometric Interpretation</span>
    We now discuss a visualization of \(\eqref{eq:f-inverse-deriv} \col\)
    The graphs of \(y = f(x)\) and \(y = \inv f(x)\)
    are reflections of each other across the line \(y = x.\)
    Simply put, any point \((a, b)\) on the graph of \(f\)
    has a reflection \((b, a)\) on the graph of \(\inv f.\)
    In <a href="#inverse-diff-f">Figure 3</a>, 
    observe that the slope of the tangent to \(f\) at the point \((a, b)\) is \(m = f'(a).\)
    Reflecting this point across \(y = x\) 
    results in \((b, a)\) on the graph of \(\inv f.\)
    The slope of the tangent to \(\inv f\) at \(x = b\) must be the <i>reciprocal</i> of \(m;\) that is, 
    \[\par{\inv f}'(b) = \frac{1}{m} = \frac{1}{f'(a)} \pd\]
    But because \(\inv f(b) = a,\) we see 
    \[\par{\inv f}'(b) = \frac{1}{f'\par{\inv f(b)}} \pd\] 
    This equation is just as useful as \(\eqref{eq:f-inverse-deriv},\)
    since \(b\) can be any value of \(x\) within the domain of \(\inv f.\)

    Without complicated methods, it is impossible to determine the identity of the inverse function 
    \(\inv f.\)
    Simply put, we cannot simply find the inverse function \(\inv f(x)\) algebraically and then differentiate it.
    Instead, \(\eqref{eq:f-inverse-deriv}\) provides us the following pathway: 
    \[\par{\inv f}'(2) = \frac{1}{f' \par{\inv f(2)}} \pd\]
    By inspection we see \(f(0) = 2,\) so \(\inv f(2) = 0.\)
    Thus, 
    \[\par{\inv f}'(2) = \frac{1}{f'(0)} \pd\]
    Differentiating \(f,\) we attain 
    \[f'(x) = x^2 + 4 \implies f'(0) = 4 \pd\]
    Accordingly, 
    \[\par{\inv f}'(2) = \boxed{\tfrac{1}{4}}\]

<p>
    We now differentiate the inverse trigonometric functions \(\asin x,\)
    \(\acos x,\) \(\atan x,\) \(\asec x,\) \(\acsc x,\) and \(\acot x.\)
    All of these derivatives can be obtained by using inverse differentiation (or implicit differentiation). 
    Let's do an example.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Derivative of \(\asin x\)</span>
    Let \(y = \asin x.\)
    As \(\sin\) and \(\asin\) are inverse functions, 
    we have \(x = \sin y.\)
    Noticing \(\textderiv{x}{y} = \cos y,\) we use \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\) to attain   
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\asin x} = \frac{1}{\textderiv{x}{y}} = \frac{1}{\cos y} \pd\]
    We must now relate \(1/\cos y\) to \(x = \sin y \col\) 
    The Pythagorean identity gives \(\sin^2 y + \cos^2 y = 1.\)
    Since \(-\pi/2 \leq y \leq \pi/2,\) \(\cos y \geq 0\) and we see 
    \begin{flalign}
    &&\cos y = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 y} &= \sqrt{1 - x^2} \nonum &\nl 
    \laWord{and} &&\deriv{}{x} \par{\asin x} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \pd \label{eq:deriv-arcsin}
    \end{flalign}
    We could also use implicit differentiation to obtain this same result, as follows:
    \[
    \ba 
    \deriv{}{x} \par{x} &= \deriv{}{x} \par{\sin y} \nl 
    1 &= \cos y \deriv{y}{x} \nl 
    \implies \deriv{y}{x} &= \frac{1}{\cos y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \pd 
    \ea     
    \]

</div>
<button onclick="toggle5()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution5" class="solution">
    Let \(y = \atan x.\)
    Because \(\tan\) and \(\atan\) are inverse functions, 
    we see \(x = \tan y\) and \(\textderiv{x}{y}\) \(= \sec^2 y\)
    (recall from Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/2.3-Product-Rule-and-Quotient-Rule.html">2.3</a>).
    Thus, \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\) gives   
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\atan x} = \frac{1}{\textderiv{x}{y}} = \frac{1}{\sec^2 y} \pd\]
    The Pythagorean identity relates \(\sec^2 y\) to \(x = \tan y\) as follows:
    \[\sec^2 y = \tan^2 y + 1 = x^2 + 1 \pd\]
    So we see 
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\atan x} = \boxed{\frac{1}{x^2 + 1}}\]
</div>

<div class="example-title" id="ex-asec"> EXAMPLE 6 </div>

<button onclick="toggle6()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution6" class="solution">
    Let \(y = \asec x\) so that \(x = \sec y.\)
    We therefore see \(\textderiv{x}{y} = \sec y \tan y\)
    (recall from Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/2.3-Product-Rule-and-Quotient-Rule.html">2.3</a>), so by \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\)
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{}{x} \par{\asec x} = \frac{1}{\sec y \tan y} \pd \label{eq:asec-deriv-y}
    \end{equation}
    The Pythagorean identity states that \(\tan^2 y\) \(= \sec^2 y - 1,\) or 
    \[\tan y = \pm \sqrt{\sec^2 y - 1} = \pm \sqrt{x^2 - 1} \pd\]
    The inverse secant function is defined for \(y\) in \([0, \pi/2)\)
    \(\cup \, (\pi/2, \pi].\) 
    For \(0 \leq y \lt \pi/2,\) \(\sec y \geq 0\) and \(\tan y \geq 0.\) 
    Thus, we select the positive solution of \(\tan y,\) so \(\eqref{eq:asec-deriv-y}\) becomes 
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\asec x} = \frac{1}{x \sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \pd\]
    Conversely, for \(\pi/2 \lt y \leq \pi\) we see \(\sec y \leq 0\) and \(\tan y \leq 0;\)
    accordingly, we pick the negative solution for \(\tan y\) and so \(\eqref{eq:asec-deriv-y}\) becomes 
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\asec x} = \frac{1}{x \par{-\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}} \pd\]
    Note that \(x\) is a negative quantity for \(\pi/2 \lt y \leq \pi,\) so the entire denominator is positive. 
    Therefore, we simplify by writing \(x = -\abs x \col\)   
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\asec x} = \frac{1}{- \abs x \par{-\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}} = \boxed{\frac{1}{\abs x \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}}\]
    The absolute value bars around the \(x\) ensure that this derivative is always positive.

    Applying the method of inverse differentiation (or implicit differentiation) gives us
    formulas for all six inverse trigonometric functions. \(\eqrefer{eq:deriv-arcsin}\)
    gives the derivative of \(\asin x;\) and we found the derivatives of \(\atan x\) and 
    \(\asec x\) in  <a href="#ex-arctan">Example 5</a> and <a href="#ex-asec">Example 6</a>, respectively.
    Differentiating the remaining three functions are similar, so they are left as exercises in the Exercises section.

        <li>
            Any inverse trigonometric function containing the prefix <i>co-</i>
