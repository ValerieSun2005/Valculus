    We have differentiated functions in the form \(y = f(x)\).
    But sometimes it's impossible to express \(y\) as a function of \(x.\)
    In these cases, we write <i>implicit equations</i> to relate \(x\) and \(y.\)
    The method of <i>implicit differentiation</i> enables us to find slopes to a curve 
    without needing to solve for \(y\) explicitly. 
    We apply implicit differentiation to differentiate inverse functions, which make up
    the remaining functions we have yet to discuss. 
    We cover the following topics:

<h4 id="implicit-diff">Implicit Differentiation</h4>

<p>
    An equation of the form \(y = f(x)\) is called an  
    <span class="emph">explicit equation</span>, examples of which are 
    \(y = x - 4\) and \(y = x^2 - 4x.\)
    Conversely, an <span class="emph">implicit equation</span>
    relates \(x\) and \(y\) through an equation in which \(y\) isn't expressed as a function of \(x.\)
    Examples of implicit equations are 
    \[x^2 + xy = 6 \and 9x - 4y = 0 \pd\]
    <span class="emph">Implicit differentiation</span> is the process by which we obtain 
    \(\textderiv{y}{x}\) by treating \(y\) as a function of \(x\) and applying the Chain Rule 
    (from Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/2.4-Chain-Rule.html">2.4</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Many curves are best expressed as explicit equations.
    For example, the equation of a unit circle is   
    \begin{equation} 
    x^2 + y^2 = 1 \pd \label{eq:unit-circle}
    \end{equation}
    The curve generated by a unit circle contains <i>all the coordinates \((x, y)\)</i>
    for which \(\eqref{eq:unit-circle}\) holds true.
    Writing the implicit equation \(\eqref{eq:unit-circle}\) 
    enables us to represent the entire circle without needing to solve for \(y.\)
    To determine the slope of this circle at any point \((x, y),\)
    we use <b>implicit differentiation</b> to attain \(\textderiv{y}{x} \col\)
    We treat \(y\) as \(y(x),\) a function of \(x,\)
    so \(\eqRef{eq:unit-circle}\) should be thought of as   
    \[x^2 + [y(x)]^2 = 1 \pd\]
    Now we differentiate both sides with respect to \(x,\)
    using the Chain Rule to differentiate \(y(x).\) Doing so gives  
    \[2x + 2y \deriv{y}{x} = 0 \pd\]
    Now we solve for \(\textDeriv{y}{x} \col\)
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = -\frac{x}{y} \pd\] 
    <figure class="implicit-diff-circle" id="implicit-diff-circle">

<p>
    <a href="#implicit-diff-circle">Figure 1</a> shows a diagram of a unit circle with a tangent line.
    At \((0, -1)\) and \((0, 1),\) the circle has horizontal tangents because \(\textderiv{y}{x} = 0.\)
    Conversely, at \((-1, 0)\) and \((1, 0)\) the circle has vertical tangents
    and so \(\textderiv{y}{x} = 0\) is undefined.
    Hence, \(\textDeriv{y}{x} = -x/y\) appears mathematically accurate. 
    Solving for \(y\) in \(\eqref{eq:unit-circle}\) would yield two explicit equations, \(y = f(x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2}\)
    and \(y = g(x) = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}.\)
    The graph of \(f\) represents the top half of the unit circle, while the graph of \(g\) represents the bottom half.  
    Indeed, we see
    \[
    \baat{2}
    f'(x) &= \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \lspace g'(x) &&= \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \nl 
    &= \frac{-x}{y} &&= \frac{x}{y} \pd
    \eaat 
    \]  
    These results agree with our result \(\textDeriv{y}{x} = -x/y,\) obtained from implicit differentiation. 
    Note that \(g'(x) = x/y\) is correct because \(y \lt 0.\)
<p>
<p>
    In some cases, we can directly solve for \(y\) in an implicit equation, 
    just as we did with \(\eqref{eq:unit-circle}.\)
    Similar to the unit circle example, 
    the implicit equation \(xy = 1\) can be written explicitly as \(y = 1/x.\)
    Thus, \(\textderiv{y}{x}\) can be found by simply applying the Power Rule—no implicit differentiation needed.
    Yet in most cases, <i>solving for \(y\) explicitly is impossible</i> 
    and implicit differentiation is needed to acquire \(\textderiv{y}{x}.\)
    Let's establish a set of steps to perform implicit differentiation.

        The curve has a <b>horizontal tangent</b> when \(\textderiv{y}{x} = 0.\)
        For an <i>implicit</i> curve, we must describe locations as points—that is, 
        we need both \(x\) and \(y.\)
        In \(\eqref{eq:dy/dx-tangents}\) we observe that \(\textderiv{y}{x} = 0\)
        when the numerator is \(0\) and the denominator is nonzero. 
        So solving shows
        \[-y^2 - 2xy = 0 \implies x = -\tfrac{1}{2} y \pd\]
        Plugging this expression into \(x^2 y = 2 - xy^2,\) we see   
        \[
        \ba 
        \par{-\tfrac{1}{2} y}^2 y &= 2 - \par{-\tfrac{1}{2} y} y^2 \nl

        y^3 &= -8 \nl 
        \implies y &= -2 \pd

        The \(x\)-coordinate corresponding to \(y = -2\) is \(x = -\tfrac{1}{2}(-2)\)

        The curve has a <b>vertical tangent</b> when the denominator of \(\textderiv{y}{x}\) 
        is \(0\) and the numerator is nonzero. In \(\eqref{eq:dy/dx-tangents}\) 
        equating \(x^2 + 2xy\) to \(0\) shows 
        \[x(x + 2y) = 0 \implies x = -2y \pd\]
        (We ignore the solution \(x = 0\) because it does not satisfy the implicit equation 
        \(x^2 y = 2 - xy^2.\))
        Substituting \(x = -2y\) into the implicit equation 
        shows 
        \[

<h4 id="inverse-diff">Differentiating Inverse Functions</h4>
<p>
    A function \(f\) has an <b>inverse function</b> \(\inv f\) if and only if 
    \[f \par{\inv f(x)} = x \or \inv f (f(x)) = x \pd\]
    In other words, composing a function with its inverse function must return the 
    independent variable.
    For example, the functions \(\sin x\) and \(\asin x\) 
    are inverse functions, just as \(2^x\) and \(\log_2 x\) are inverse functions. 
</p>
<p>
    Let \(f\) be an invertible and differentiable function.
    To differentiate its inverse function \(\inv f,\) we apply implicit differentiation to the equation 
    \[f \par{\inv{f} (x)} = x \pd\]
    Our goal is to obtain an expression for \(\par{\inv f}'(x),\)
    the derivative of \(\inv{f} \) with respect to \(x.\)
    Differentiating both sides with respect to \(x\) shows 
    \begin{flalign}
    &&f'\par{\inv f(x)} \cdot \par{\inv f}'(x) &= 1 \nonum &\nl
    \laWord{so} && \par{\inv f}'(x) &= \frac{1}{f'\par{\inv f(x)}} \pd \label{eq:f-inverse-deriv}
    \end{flalign}
    Alternatively, if we let \(y = \inv f(x),\) then we see \(x = f(y)\) and 
    \(\textderiv{x}{y} = f'(y).\)
    Accordingly, \(\eqref{eq:f-inverse-deriv}\) becomes 
    \begin{flalign} 
    &&\par{\inv f}'(x) &= \frac{1}{f'(y)} \nonum &\nl
    \laWord{or} &&\deriv{y}{x} &= \frac{1}{\textderiv{x}{y}} \pd \label{eq:dx/dy}
    \end{flalign}
    Hence, \(\eqref{eq:f-inverse-deriv}\) and \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\) are 
    expressions we can use to differentiate an inverse function. 
    \(\eqrefer{eq:dx/dy}\) is convenient if we can express \(x\) as a function of \(y,\)
    since we obtain a derivative function. 
    Conversely, \(\eqref{eq:f-inverse-deriv}\) can be used to find the derivative of an inverse function 
    at some point. 
    The relationship of \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\) is particularly elegant, 
    since it strengthens the magic of Leibniz's notation 
    in connecting the differentials \(\dd x\) and \(\dd y.\)

    results in \((b, a)\) on the graph of \(\inv f.\)
    The slope of the tangent to \(\inv f\) at \(x = b\) must be the <i>reciprocal</i> of \(m;\) that is, 
    \[\par{\inv f}'(b) = \frac{1}{m} = \frac{1}{f'(a)} \pd\]
    But because \(\inv f(b) = a,\) we see

    The inverse function of \(e^x\) is called the <span class="emph">natural logarithm</span>
    (abbreviated by the symbol \(\ln\)),

    <span class="label-emph">Derivative of Natural Logarithm</span>
    It is easy to obtain the formula for the derivative of \(\ln x.\)
    Let \(y = \ln x.\)
    It follows that \(x = e^y,\) so \(\textderiv{x}{y} = e^y.\)
    Thus, \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\) gives 
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\ln x} = \frac{1}{\textderiv{x}{y}} = \frac{1}{e^y} \pd\]
    But since \(x = e^y,\)
    we attain 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{}{x} \par{\ln x} = \frac{1}{x} \pd \label{eq:deriv-ln-x}
    \end{equation}
    It is astonishing that the rate of change of the natural logarithm, 
    which we must define using the irrational number \(e \approx 2.718,\)
    turns out to be such a clean result—the reciprocal function.
    \(\eqrefer{eq:deriv-ln-x}\) is extremely useful and is central to many operations we will perform in future chapters.
    This result is intuitive because \(y = \ln x\)
    slows in growth as \(x\) increases; \(\eqref{eq:deriv-ln-x}\)
    corroborates this observation by asserting that the curve's tangents decrease to \(0\) as \(x \to \infty\)
    (<a href="#lnx-graph">Figure 4</a>).
    Paradoxically, although its tangents decrease to \(0\) as \(x\) grows,
    the function \(\ln x\) grows to infinity as \(x\) approaches infinity—that is, 
    \(\lim_{x \to \infty} \ln x = \infty.\)
</p>
<p>
    A purist may wish to obtain \(\eqref{eq:deriv-ln-x}\) by performing implicit differentiation 
    on the equation \(x = e^y\) instead of memorizing \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy},\) 
    which we derived from applying implicit differentiation on <i>any inverse function</i>.
    The steps are as follows:
    \[
    \ba 
    \deriv{}{x} (x) &= \deriv{}{x} \par{e^y} \nl 
    1 &= e^y \deriv{y}{x} \nl 
    \implies \deriv{y}{x} &= \frac{1}{e^y} = \frac{1}{x} \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    Thus, we have officially united \(e^x\) with its twin, \(\ln x.\)

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Differentiating Logarithms of Any Base</span>
    \(\eqrefer{eq:deriv-ln-x}\) gives the derivative of a logarithmic function whose base is \(e.\)
    But if the base is any positive number \(b,\) then the Change of Base Rule for Logarithms 
    holds that 
    \[\log_b x = \frac{\ln x}{\ln b} \pd\]
    Since \(b\) is a constant, \(\ln b\) is a constant.
    Thus, 
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\log_b x} = \frac{1}{\ln b} \cdot \deriv{}{x} \par{\ln x} \pd\]
    Then using \(\eqref{eq:deriv-ln-x}\) gives 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{}{x} \par{\log_b x} = \frac{1}{x \ln b} \pd \label{eq:deriv-log-b}
    \end{equation}
    Observe that \(\eqref{eq:deriv-log-b}\) agrees with \(\eqref{eq:deriv-ln-x}\)
    because \(\ln b = 1\) if \(b = e.\)
    This explains why we use the number \(e\) in calculus—so that the derivatives of \(e^x\) and \(\ln x\)
    are very convenient to use.

    We now differentiate the inverse trigonometric functions \(\asin x,\)
    \(\acos x,\) \(\atan x,\) \(\asec x,\) \(\acsc x,\) and \(\acot x.\)
    All of these derivatives can be obtained by using inverse differentiation (or implicit differentiation). 
    Let's do an example.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Derivative of \(\asin x\)</span>
    Let \(y = \asin x.\)
    As \(\sin\) and \(\asin\) are inverse functions, 
    we have \(x = \sin y.\)
    Noticing \(\textderiv{x}{y} = \cos y,\) we use \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\) to attain   
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\asin x} = \frac{1}{\textderiv{x}{y}} = \frac{1}{\cos y} \pd\]
    We must now relate \(1/\cos y\) to \(x = \sin y \col\) 
    The Pythagorean identity gives \(\sin^2 y + \cos^2 y = 1.\)
    Since \(-\pi/2 \leq y \leq \pi/2,\) \(\cos y \geq 0\) and we see 
    \begin{flalign}
    &&\cos y = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 y} &= \sqrt{1 - x^2} \nonum &\nl 
    \laWord{and} &&\deriv{}{x} \par{\asin x} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \pd \label{eq:deriv-arcsin}
    \end{flalign}
    We could also use implicit differentiation to obtain this same result, as follows:
    \[
    \ba 
    \deriv{}{x} \par{x} &= \deriv{}{x} \par{\sin y} \nl 
    1 &= \cos y \deriv{y}{x} \nl 
    \implies \deriv{y}{x} &= \frac{1}{\cos y} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \pd

<div id="solution8" class="solution">
    Let \(y = \atan x.\)
    Because \(\tan\) and \(\atan\) are inverse functions,

    (recall from Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/2.3-Product-Rule-and-Quotient-Rule.html">2.3</a>).
    Thus, \(\eqref{eq:dx/dy}\) gives   
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\atan x} = \frac{1}{\textderiv{x}{y}} = \frac{1}{\sec^2 y} \pd\]
    The Pythagorean identity relates \(\sec^2 y\) to \(x = \tan y\) as follows:
    \[\sec^2 y = \tan^2 y + 1 = x^2 + 1 \pd\]

    Let \(y = \asec x\) so that \(x = \sec y.\)

    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{}{x} \par{\asec x} = \frac{1}{\sec y \tan y} \pd \label{eq:asec-deriv-y}
    \end{equation}
    The Pythagorean identity states that \(\tan^2 y\) \(= \sec^2 y - 1,\) or 
    \[\tan y = \pm \sqrt{\sec^2 y - 1} = \pm \sqrt{x^2 - 1} \pd\]
    The inverse secant function is defined for \(y\) in \([0, \pi/2)\)
    \(\cup \, (\pi/2, \pi].\) 
    For \(0 \leq y \lt \pi/2,\) \(\sec y \geq 0\) and \(\tan y \geq 0.\) 
    Thus, we select the positive solution of \(\tan y,\) so \(\eqref{eq:asec-deriv-y}\) becomes 
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\asec x} = \frac{1}{x \sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \pd\]
    Conversely, for \(\pi/2 \lt y \leq \pi\) we see \(\sec y \leq 0\) and \(\tan y \leq 0;\)
    accordingly, we pick the negative solution for \(\tan y\) and so \(\eqref{eq:asec-deriv-y}\) becomes 
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\asec x} = \frac{1}{x \par{-\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}} \pd\]
    Note that \(x\) is a negative quantity for \(\pi/2 \lt y \leq \pi,\) so the entire denominator is positive. 
    Therefore, we simplify by writing \(x = -\abs x \col\)   
    \[\deriv{}{x} \par{\asec x} = \frac{1}{- \abs x \par{-\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}} = \boxed{\frac{1}{\abs x \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}}\]
    The absolute value bars around the \(x\) ensure that this derivative is always positive.

        Alternatively, if \(y\) is an invertible, differentiable function of \(x,\) then 
        \[\deriv{y}{x} = \frac{1}{\textderiv{x}{y}} \pd \eqlabel{eq:dx/dy}\]
        You can either use these formulas or perform implicit differentiation to attain derivatives of inverse functions.

        The <span class="emph">natural logarithm</span> is the inverse function of \(e^x.\)
        We denote the natural logarithm as \(\ln x,\)
        whose base is \(e\) and derivative is 
        \begin{equation} 
        \deriv{}{x} \par{\ln x} = \frac{1}{x} \pd \eqlabel{eq:deriv-ln-x}

        If \(b\) is a positive constant, then 
        \begin{equation} 
        \deriv{}{x} \par{\log_b x} = \frac{1}{x \ln b} \pd \eqlabel{eq:deriv-log-b}

        The following tips may help you remember these derivatives:
        <ol class="list-num">
            <li>
                Any inverse trigonometric function containing the prefix <i>co-</i>
                (inverse cosine, inverse cosecant, and inverse cotangent) has a negative sign in its derivative.
            </li>
            <li>
                Think of three groups of inverse functions: sine and cosine, tangent and cotangent, and secant and cosecant. 
                Members of each group have identical derivatives, apart from the negative sign carried by members with the prefix <i>co-</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inverse tangent and inverse cotangent are the only inverse trigonometric functions whose derivatives 
                do not have radicals.
