    In this section we introduce the <i>logistic function</i>, 
    which has many applications in modeling population growth, disease spread, and social media engagement.
    We modify the <i>exponential function</i> (from Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/8.3-Exponential-Models.html">8.3</a>)
    to characterize limited growth. 
    This section covers the following topics:

<p>
    In Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/8.3-Exponential-Models.html">8.3</a> we modeled 
    populations that grow <i>exponentially</i>. 
    Under these models, we assumed that species had the resources to reproduce indefinitely.  
    Yet a limit exists to how many individuals a population can sustain; 
    we call this limit the <span class="emph">carrying capacity</span> of an ecosystem. 
    To model these ecosystems, we need a function that grows exponentially when the population is small 
    but slows in growth as the population approaches its carrying capacity.

<p>
    If \(y\) grows exponentially with \(x,\) then \(y\) satisfies the differential equation
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = ky \cma\]
    where \(k\) is a positive constant. 
    To slow the growth as \(y\) approaches the <i>carrying capacity</i>
    \(L,\) we modify the exponential model by including the factor 
    \(\par{1 - y/L}\) on the right side. 
    Doing so gives the model
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{x} = ky \par{1 - \frac{y}{L}} \pd \label{eq:logistic-diff-eq}  
    \end{equation}
    This differential equation defines <span class="emph">logistic growth</span>. 
    Observe that as \(y\) grows toward \(L,\) the factor \((1 - y/L)\) approaches \(0\)
    and so \(\textDeriv{y}{x}\) approaches \(0.\)
    Accordingly, the growth of \(y\) is inhibited as \(y \to L.\)
    If \(y\) represents a population of animals and \(x\) is time, then the model in
    \(\eqref{eq:logistic-diff-eq}\) ensures <i>the population growth halts as the population approaches its carrying capacity</i>. 
    Note that the rate of change of \(y\) depends only on itself, not on \(x.\)
    The solution to \(\eqref{eq:logistic-diff-eq}\) is 
    \begin{equation} 
    y = \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{-kx}} \pd \label{eq:logistic-eq}
    \end{equation}
    We see that 
    \[
    \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{-kx}} = L \and \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{-kx}} = 0 \pd
    \]
    Thus, \(y = 0\) and \(y = L\)—the line representing the carrying capacity—are <i>horizontal asymptotes</i> of a logistic 
    model. 
    A quantity undergoing logistic growth is constantly increasing
    toward the carrying capacity.
    Because the graph's shape resembles the letter <i>J</i>, 
    a logistic curve can be called an <i>S-curve</i>.
    (See <a href="#logistic-growth">Figure 1</a>.)

    \end{equation}
    whose solution is 
    \begin{equation} 
    y = \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{-kx}} \pd \eqlabel{eq:logistic-eq}
    \end{equation}
</div>

<p>
    <span class="proof">PROOF OF \(\eqref{eq:logistic-eq}\)</span>
    We rewrite \(\eqref{eq:logistic-diff-eq}\) as  
    \[
    \ba 
    \deriv{y}{x} &= ky \par{\frac{L - y}{L}} \nl 
    \frac{1}{ky(L - y)} \di y &= \frac{1}{L} \di x \pd \nl 
    \ea  
    \]
    We break the left side into <i>partial fractions</i>
    (from Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/6.4-Integration-by-Partial-Fractions.html">6.4</a>):
    \begin{equation} 
    \par{\frac{A}{ky} + \frac{B}{L - y}} \di y = \frac{1}{L} \di x \pd \label{eq:logistic-partial-fractions}
    \end{equation}
    On the left side, we see
    \[
    \ba 
    \frac{A}{ky} + \frac{B}{L - y} &= \frac{1}{ky(L - y)} \nl 
    \frac{A(L - y) + Bky}{ky(L - y)} &= \frac{1}{ky(L - y)} \nl 
    A(L - y) + Bky &= 1 \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    Letting \(y = 0\) shows 
    \[A(L - 0) + Bk(0) = 1 \implies A = \frac{1}{L} \pd\]
    Similarly, for \(y = L\) we see   
    \[A(0) + Bk(L) = 1 \implies B = \frac{1}{kL} \pd\]
    Thus, \(\eqref{eq:logistic-partial-fractions}\) becomes 
    \[
    \ba
    \par{\frac{1/L}{ky} + \frac{1/kL}{L - y}} \di y &= \frac{1}{L} \di x \nl
    \par{\frac{1}{y} - \frac{1}{y - L}} \di y &= k \di x \pd
    \ea
    \]
    Integrating both sides gives 
    \[
    \ba 
    \ln \abs{y} - \ln \abs{y - L} &= kx + C_1 \nl 
    \ln \abs{y - L} - \ln \abs{y} &= C_1 - kx \nl 
    \ln \abs{\frac{y - L}{y}} &= C_1 - kx \nl 
    \ln \abs{1 - \frac{L}{y}} &= C_1 - kx \nl
    \ln \abs{\frac{L}{y} - 1} &= C_1 - kx \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    We now exponentiate both sides, obtaining
    \[
    \ba 
    \frac{L}{y} - 1 &= e^{C_1 - kx} \nl 
    &= e^{C_1} e^{-kx} \pd 
    \ea 
    \]
    If we let \(C = \pm e^{C_1},\) then we attain 
    \begin{align}
    \frac{L}{y} &= 1 + Ce^{-kx} \nonum \nl 
    y &= \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{-kx}} \pd \eqlabel{eq:logistic-eq}

        We compare this differential equation to \(\eqref{eq:logistic-diff-eq},\)

        Thus, the general solution to the differential equation is, by comparison to \(\eqref{eq:logistic-eq},\)

    Whereas a quantity is always increasing under logistic <i>growth</i>,
    a quantity is always <i>decreasing</i> under <span class="emph">logistic decay</span>. 
    Recall that \(y\) <i>decays exponentially</i> with \(x\) if 
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = -ky \cma\]
    where \(k\) is a positive constant.
    Similar to our strategy in <a href="#logistic-growth" class="page-anchor">Logistic Growth</a>, 
    we tack on the factor \((1 - y/L)\) to attain 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{x} = -ky \par{1 - \frac{y}{L}} \pd \label{eq:decay-diff-eq}
    \end{equation}
    In this differential equation, the rate of decay of \(y\) slows as \(y\) approaches 
    \(L.\)
    Because \(\eqref{eq:decay-diff-eq}\) is analogous to \(\eqref{eq:logistic-diff-eq}\) 
    (the negative sign is the only discrepancy),
    its solution is given by replacing \(k\) with \(-k\) in 
    \(\eqref{eq:logistic-eq} \col\)
    \begin{flalign} 
    &&y &= \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{-(-k)x}} \nonum &\nl
    \laWord{or} && y &= \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{kx}} \pd \label{eq:logistic-decay}
    \end{flalign}
    Observe that 
    \[\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{kx}} = L \and \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{kx}} = 0 \pd\]
    Thus, \(y = 0\) and \(y = L\) are the horizontal asymptotes 
    of this curve. 
    Unlike a logistic <i>growth</i> model, 
    a logistic <i>decay</i> model approaches \(0\)
    as \(x \to \infty\)
    and is <i>always decreasing</i>.

        Substituting \(f(0) = 700\) shows 
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{1500}{1 + Ce^0} &= 700 \nl

        \implies C &= \tfrac{8}{7} \pd

        Substituting \(f(5) = 400,\) we attain

        \ba 
        \frac{1500}{1 + \tfrac{8}{7}e^{5k}} &= 400 \nl 
        1 + \tfrac{8}{7}e^{5k} &= \tfrac{15}{4} \nl

        &= \boxed{\frac{1500}{1 + \tfrac{8}{7} \par{\tfrac{77}{32}}^{x/5}}}

<h4 id="properties-logistic-models">Properties of Logistic Functions</h4>
<p>
    We can undercover many facts about a logistic function by determining its second derivative.
    In \(\eqref{eq:logistic-diff-eq}\) we use the Chain Rule to differentiate \(y\) with respect to \(x;\)
    doing so gives 
    \[
    \ba 
    \derivOrder{y}{x}{2} &= k \deriv{y}{x} \par{1 - \frac{y}{L}} + ky \par{-\frac{1}{L}} \deriv{y}{x} \nl 
    &= k \deriv{y}{x} \par{1 - \frac{2y}{L}} \pd 
    \ea 
    \]
    Recall, from Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/3.4-Using-the-First-and-Second-Derivatives.html">3.4</a>, 
    that a function has an inflection point when \(\textderivOrder{y}{x}{2}\)
    changes sign. 
    We therefore equate the second derivative to \(0\) to see
    \[
    \ba 
    k \deriv{y}{x} \par{1 - \frac{2y}{L}} &= 0 \nl 
    \implies y &= \frac{L}{2} \pd
    \ea 
    \] 
    Note that \(\textderiv{y}{x}\) never changes sign,
    and we attain the same result for logistic decay by differentiating \(\eqref{eq:decay-diff-eq}.\)
    At \(y = L/2,\) for both logistic growth and logistic decay, \(\textderivOrder{y}{x}{2}\) changes sign from positive to negative.
    Therefore, a logistic function <i>has an inflection point when \(y\) reaches half of the carrying capacity</i>.
    Also observe the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The graph of a logistic function is concave up for \(y \lt L/2\)
            and concave down for \(y \gt L/2.\)
        </li>
        <li>
            A logistic <i>growth</i> function exhibits the fastest rate of growth 
            when it reaches the inflection point at \(y = L/2.\)
            (See <a href="#logistic-growth-inflection">Figure 7A</a>.)
        </li>
        <li>
            A logistic <i>decay</i> function decreases fastest 
            upon reaching the inflection point at \(y = L/2.\)
            (See <a href="#logistic-decay-inflection">Figure 7B</a>.)
        </li>
    </ul>
    Note that all of these conditions assume no vertical shift in the logistic graph. 
    In other words, these properties hold true only if graph has horizontal asymptotes of \(y = 0\) and \(y = L.\)

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Modeling Disease</span>
    Logistic functions are excellent models for the recorded number of cases 
    of a disease.  
    One such example is modeling <b>smallpox</b>, a disease that ravaged the world for millennia. 
    Fortunately, due to the advances in medicine and vaccine development, 
    new cases became exceedingly rare in the 1950s and 1960s.
    In 1980, the World Health Organization 
    declared smallpox to be eradicated; 
    today, billions of children live without fear of smallpox.
    <a href="#logistic-graph-smallpox">Figure 8</a> shows data points
    representing the number of total documented cases, in millions, of smallpox 
    in the United States each year after 1900.
    By the method of regression analysis, the logistic growth function
    \[y = \frac{1.49}{1 + e^{-0.15(t - 1918)}}\]
    is a good fit for these data. 
    Observe that the spread of smallpox accelerated from 1900 to 1920;
    around 1920, the logistic curve contains an <i>inflection point</i>—the 
    point at which new cases were increasing most rapidly.  
    But after hitting the inflection point, the spread of smallpox
    diminished between 1930 and 1940.
    (A logistic growth model is concave down for \(y\) past the inflection point, 
    meaning the growth <i>rate</i> of \(y\) is decreasing.)
    In 1949 the last natural outbreak of smallpox occurred in the United States.
    Accordingly, our logistic model asserts that the total number of cases undergoes almost no change
    after \(t = 1949.\)
    Therefore, during an outbreak scientists often look for inflection points 
    in the total number of recorded cases, since they signal diminishing infections ahead.
    For example, during the COVID-19 virus pandemic—amid years of isolation, millions of devastated families, 
    and sharp increases in mental health issues—epidemiologists were pleased to discover 
    an inflection point in the count of total cases, about four years after the virus's onset in China in 2019.

<div class="example-title"> EXAMPLE 5 </div>
<div class="example">
    <div class="example-problem">  
        An initial outbreak of \(20\) infected residents 
        causes a disease to spread throughout a \(4000\)-person town.
        The following day, \(4\) more residents are infected. 
        Assuming logistic growth with a carrying capacity of \(2000\) cases, 
        after how many days from the onset of the disease is its infection rate the highest?

<button onclick="toggle5()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution5" class="solution">
    <p>
        The disease's growth rate is <i>highest</i> when the number of total cases 
        equals <i>half of the carrying capacity</i>, provided to be \(L = 2000.\)
        By \(\eqref{eq:logistic-eq}\) a logistic growth function for the number of cases 
        is given by 
        \[y = \frac{2000}{1 + Ce^{-kt}} \cma\]
        where \(t\) is time in days.
        We want to find the time \(t\) at which \(y = L/2\) \(= 1000.\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="label-emph">Solving for \(C\) and \(k\)</span>
        Note the initial conditions \(y(0) = 20\) and \(y(1) = 24.\)
        Substituting the former condition shows 
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{2000}{1 + Ce^{0}} &= 20 \nl 
        1 + C &= 100 \nl 
        \implies C &= 99 \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        Then substituting \(y(1) = 24\) reveals 
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{2000}{1 + 99e^{-k}} &= 24 \nl 
        1 + 99 e^{-k} &= \tfrac{250}{3} \nl 
        \implies k &= -\ln \tfrac{247}{297} \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        Thus, the logistic function modeling the cases of the virus is 
        \[
        \ba 
        y &= \frac{2000}{1 + 99e^{-\par{-\ln \tfrac{247}{297}}t}} \nl 
        &= \frac{2000}{1 + 99 \par{\tfrac{247}{297}}^t} \pd
        \ea 
        \] 
        We therefore see 
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{2000}{1 + 99 \par{\tfrac{247}{297}}^t} &= 1000 \nl 
        1 + 99 \par{\tfrac{247}{297}}^t &= 2 \nl 
        \implies t &= \log_{247/297} \par{\tfrac{1}{99}} \approx \boxed{25 \un{days}}
        \ea
