        The enclosed region is in the first quadrant

        Since we consider cross sections <i>perpendicular</i>
        to the \(y\)-axis, we want to express all quantities in terms of \(y.\)
        Let's rewrite \(y = x^2\) as \(x = \sqrt y.\)
        At each \(y,\) the cross section to the solid perpendicular

        \[A(y) = \par{\sqrt y \, } \par{3 \sqrt y \,} = 3 y \pd\]

        The cross sections perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis are semicircles;

        The <i>radius</i> of each semicircle is therefore

        The phrase "parallel to the \(x\)-axis"
        means perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis. 
        Accordingly, we want to express all quantities in terms of \(y.\)
        We rewrite \(y = x^3\) as \(x = \sqrt[3]{y}.\)      
        At each \(y,\) the cross section to the solid \(S\) perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis 
        is an equilateral triangle of side length \(x = \sqrt[3]{y}.\)
        The triangle's height is therefore \(x\sqrt{3}/2\) \(= \sqrt[3]{y} \sqrt{3}/2,\)
        while its length is \(x = \sqrt[3]{y}.\)
        So at each \(y,\) the cross-sectional area of the solid is 
        \[A(y) = \tfrac{1}{2} \par{\sqrt[3]{y} \,} \par{\frac{\sqrt[3] y \sqrt 3}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt 3}{4} y^{2/3} \pd\]
        The volume of \(S\) is given by integrating \(A(y)\) from \(y = 0\) to \(y = 8,\)
        as follows:
        \[
        \ba 
        V &amp;= \int_0^8 A(y) \di y = \frac{\sqrt 3}{4} \int_0^8 y^{2/3} \di y \nl

        &amp;= \boxed{\frac{24 \sqrt 3 }{5}} \approx 8.314 \pd

        A <b>hemisphere</b> is half of a sphere. 
        Thus, its cross sections perpendicular to either the \(x\)-axis 
        or \(y\)-axis are semicircles.
        Let's proceed with calculations such that 
        the cross sections are perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis.
        (Or we could model the cross sections to be perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis; 
        either choice gives the same volume.)
        We solve for \(y\) to find \(y = \pm \sqrt{25 - x^2}.\)
        The <i>diameter</i> of a semicircle is \(2y,\)
        from which its <i>radius</i> is \(y,\) so its area is 
        \[A(x) = \tfrac{1}{2} \pi y^2 = \frac{\pi}{2} \par{25 - x^2} \pd\]
        The circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\) has vertices at \((-5, 0)\) and \((5, 0);\)
        hence, to attain the volume \(V\) we integrate \(A(x)\) from \(x = -5\)
        to \(x = 5.\)
        Doing so—and because the integrand is even, we exploit symmetry to simplify 
        calculations—we see
        \[
        \ba 
        V &amp;= \int_{-5}^5 A(x) \di x = \frac{\pi}{2} \int_{-5}^5 \par{25 - x^2} \di x \nl 
        &amp;= \pi \int_0^5 \par{25 - x^2} \di x \nl

        &amp;= \boxed{\frac{250 \pi}{3}} \approx 261.799 \pd

        the cross section to the solid is a rectangle of base

        Its cross-sectional area is therefore

        We now integrate this function from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 1\) 
        to attain the volume:
        \[V = \int_0^1 \frac{3x}{x^2 + 2} \di x \pd\]
        To evaluate this integral, we perform a substitution 
        with \(u = x^2 + 2.\)
        (See Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/4.4-Integration-by-Substitution.html">4.4</a>

        Then \(\dd u = 2x \di x.\)
        When \(x = 0,\) \(u = 2;\) when \(x = 1,\) \(u = 3.\)
        So the integral becomes 
        \[

        For what value of \(k\) is the solid's volume maximized?

        At each \(x,\) the cross section perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis 
        is a rectangle of base \(f(x)\)
        and height \(k.\)
        Its cross-sectional area is therefore 
        \[A(x) = k f(x) = \frac{k}{(kx)^2 + 1} \pd\]
        The solid's volume is given by integrating this function from \(x = 1\)
        to \(x = 2,\) as follows:
        \[
        \ba 
        V &amp;= \int_1^2 \frac{k}{(kx)^2 + 1} \di x \nl 
        &amp;= \atan kx \intEval_1^2 = \atan 2k - \atan k \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        (We mentally performed the substitution \(u = kx\) to attain this antiderivative.)
        To calculate the value of \(k\) for which \(V\) is maximized, 
        we differentiate \(V\) with respect to \(k\) and locate its critical points. 
        (See Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/3.6-Optimization.html">3.6</a>
        to review the process of <b>optimization</b>.)
        Doing so, we set \(\textderiv{V}{k} = 0\)
        and solve for \(k.\)
        We find the derivative to be 
        \[
        \ba 
        \deriv{V}{k} &amp;= \frac{2}{(2k)^2 + 1} - \frac{1}{k^2 + 1} \nl 
        &amp;= \frac{2k^2 + 2 - 4k^2 - 1}{\par{4k^2 + 1} \par{k^2 + 1}} \nl
        &amp;= \frac{-2k^2 + 1}{\par{4k^2 + 1} \par{k^2 + 1}} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        So we see 
        \[\frac{-2k^2 + 1}{\par{4k^2 + 1} \par{k^2 + 1}} = 0 \iffArrow -2k^2 + 1 = 0 \iffArrow k = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \pd\]
        This value corresponds to a relative maximum of \(V\)
        because \(\textderiv{V}{k}\) changes 
        sign from positive to negative at \(k = 1/\sqrt 2.\)
        Since \(V = 0\) when \(k = 0\)
        and 
        \[\lim_{k \to \infty} V = \lim_{k \to \infty} \par{\atan 2k - \atan k} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\pi}{2} = 0 \cma\]
        the relative maximum at \(k = 1/\sqrt 2\) must be the location of the <i>absolute maximum</i>
        of \(V.\)
        So the volume is maximized for \(k = \boxed{1/\sqrt 2}.\)
