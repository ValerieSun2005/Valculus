    In Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/4.2-Definite-Integrals.html">4.2</a>
    we calculated areas of regions bounded between a function and the \(x\)-axis.
    But we now compute areas of regions bounded between two or more functions. 
    In doing so, we discuss the following:

<p>
    In <a href="#areas-between-curves-x">Figure 1</a>, region \(R\) 
    is bounded between two continuous functions \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) 
    and between the lines \(x = a\) and \(x = b.\)
    We proceed by demanding that \(f(x) \geq g(x)\) for all \(x\) in \([a, b].\) 
    To find the area, we construct a Riemann sum in which we cut \(R\) into \(n\)
    rectangles of equal width \(\Delta x.\)
    Each rectangle's height is the <i>difference</i> between \(f(x_i^*)\) and \(g(x_i^*).\)
    The height \(f(x)\) is bigger than the height \(g(x),\)
    so the difference \(f - g\) is a positive quantity, as we expect.
    (See <a href="#areas-between-curves-x-rectangles">Figure 2A</a>.)

<p>
    As in <a href="#areas-between-curves-x-rectangles">Figure 2B</a>, 
    we wish to sum up \(n\) of these rectangles to approximate the area \(A.\) 
    If \(n \to \infty,\) then the rectangles become thinner and therefore better approximate \(A.\)
    Our Riemann sum is therefore
    \[A = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^n [f(x_i^*) - g(x_i^*)] \, \Delta x \pd\]
    This limit is the definite integral of \(f(x) - g(x),\) so we have

<p>
    In the special case where \(f\) and \(g\) are both positive, 
    \(\eqref{eq:area-x}\) asserts that the area between the graphs is the 
    area under \(f\) minus the area under \(g.\)
    That is, 
    \[
    \ba 
    A &= [\textrm{area under} \; y = f(x)] - [\textrm{area under} \; y = g(x)] \nl 
    &= \int_a^b f(x) \di x - \int_a^b g(x) \di x \nl 
    &= \int_a^b [f(x) - g(x)] \di x \pd 
    \ea 
    \]
    (See <a href="#areas-between-curves-special-case">Figure 3</a>;
    the pink area under the graph of \(g\) is subtracted from the total orange area under the graph of \(f.\))
    It is easy to note \(\eqref{eq:area-x}\) as integrating the top function 
    minus the bottom function, or "top minus bottom."
    This idea enables us to find any area over an interval when one function is always 
    greater than another.
    We are interested in area as a <i>positive</i>, geometric quantity.

    When we solve problems, we need to visualize the situation.

    Before you integrate, ensure that in the bounded area one function is greater than the other.
    Note that \(\eqref{eq:area-x}\) should <span class="warning">never</span> return a negative result;
    the area of an enclosed region is independent of the quadrant in which it lies.

    It is imperative to sketch the bounded area (<a href="#areas-between-curves-exp-1">Figure 4</a>).
    For \(0 \leq x \leq 2,\) the graph of \(y = e^x\) is above the graph of \(y = 1.\)
    The bounded region is between the \(y\)-axis (or \(x = 0\)) and \(x = 2,\) 
    so these are the integral bounds. 
    Thus, we use \(\eqref{eq:area-x},\)
    integrating the difference \(e^x - 1,\) to get 
    \[
    \ba 
    A &= \int_0^2 \par{e^x - 1} \di x \nl

    We need to determine the points of intersection; 
    their \(x\)-coordinates are the bounds for our integral. 
    We do so by equating the two functions:
    \[x = \sqrt x \implies x = 0 \cma x = 1 \pd\]
    The graph of \(y = \sqrt x\) is above the graph of \(y = x\) over \(0 \leq x \leq 1,\)
    as in <a href="#areas-between-curves-ex-x-sqrt">Figure 5</a>.
    So we use \(\eqref{eq:area-x},\) subtracting the lower function from the upper function: 
    \[
    \ba 
    A &= \int_0^1 \par{\sqrt x - x} \di x \nl 
    &= \par{\tfrac{2}{3} x^{3/2} - \tfrac{1}{2} x^2} \intEval_0^1 \nl 
    &= \par{\tfrac{2}{3} - \tfrac{1}{2}} - 0 \nl 
    &= \boxed{\tfrac{1}{6}} 
    \ea 
    \]
</div>

<p>
    To use \(\eqref{eq:area-x},\)
    we need \(f(x) \geq g(x)\) for all \(x\) in \([a, b].\)
    But if \(g(x) \geq f(x)\) for some \(x\) in this interval,
    then we need the absolute value of the difference: 
    \[A = \int_a^b \abs{f(x) - g(x)} \di x \pd\]
    We evaluate this integral by splitting the region \(R\) into 
    subregions; in each, one function is greater than the other. 
    Summing the areas of these subregions ensures that the total area \(A\) is a positive quantity,
    as shown by the following example.

        Because the integral \(\int_{\pi/4}^{\pi/2} (\cos x - \sin x) \di x\) is negative,

        would give \(0.\)
        This is the <i>difference</i>, not the sum, of the two areas!

    Because \(\cos x \geq \sin x\) for \(0 \leq x \leq \pi/4\)
    but \(\sin x \geq \cos x\) for \(\pi/4 \leq x \leq \pi/2,\)
    the boundaries of the region do not stay the same.
    We therefore split the region at \(x = \pi/4\)
    and write two integrals, using \(\eqref{eq:area-x}\) for each.
    The left region's area is 
    \[
    \ba

    &= \sqrt{2} - 1 \pd

    We may wish to find areas bounded by functions of \(y.\)
    In <a href="#areas-between-curves-y">Figure 7</a>, region \(S\) is bounded by the functions 
    \(x = f(y)\) and \(x = g(y)\) as well as by the horizontal lines \(y = c\) and \(y = d.\)
    To compute this area, we arrange Riemann sums in which the rectangles are <i>horizontal</i>;
    <a href="#areas-between-curves-y-rect">Figure 8A</a>
    shows a typical rectangle in this scenario.
    The rectangle's area is the <i>height</i> \(\Delta y\) 
    multiplied by the <i>length</i> \(f(y_i^*) - g(y_i^*).\)
    Note that since the graph of \(f\) is to the right of \(g,\)
    \(x = f(y)\) takes on greater values of \(x\) than does \(x = g(y).\)
    Accordingly, the difference \(f - g\) is a positive quantity.

    The Riemann sum for infinitely many rectangles,
    if \(f(y) \geq g(y)\) for \(c \leq y \leq d,\) is 
    \[A = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^n [f(y_i^*) - g(y_i^*)] \, \Delta y \pd\]
    (See <a href="#areas-between-curves-y-rectangles">Figure 8B</a>.)
    This limit is the definite integral 
    \begin{equation} 
    A = \int_c^d [f(y) - g(y)] \di y \pd \label{eq:area-y}
    \end{equation}
    When we integrate a region with respect to \(y,\) we use "right minus left"
    instead of "top minus bottom," as we do with <a href="#areas-x" class="page-anchor">Areas with \(x\)</a>.
    Integrating horizontally may be unfamiliar to you.
    If so, you may find it helpful to rotate the graph counterclockwise such that 
    the horizontal cuts become rotated, vertical strips.
    Doing so shows a parallel between heights in <a href="#areas-x" class="page-anchor">Areas with \(x\)</a>
    and widths in areas with \(y.\)

    After sketching the bounded area (<a href="#areas-between-curves-y-ex">Figure 9</a>),
    it's apparent that slicing the region vertically (that is, integrating with respect to \(x\)) would be very difficult.
    But cutting the region horizontally (integrating with respect to \(y\)) 
    is convenient because 
    the function \(1 - y^2\) is to the right of the line \((1 - y)/2\)
    for all \(y\) in our region.
    This means the boundaries are the same functions, so we can just write one integral.
    We are given the intersection points, so we apply \(\eqref{eq:area-y}\) to obtain 
    \[
    \ba 
    A &= \int_{-1/2}^1 \parbr{(1 - y^2) - \tfrac{1}{2} (1 - y)} \di y \nl 
    &= \par{\tfrac{1}{2} y + \tfrac{1}{4} y^2 - \tfrac{1}{3} y^3} \intEval_{-1/2}^1 \nl 
    &= \parbr{\tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{4} - \tfrac{1}{3}} 
    - \parbr{\tfrac{1}{2} \par{-\tfrac{1}{2}} + \tfrac{1}{4} \par{-\tfrac{1}{2}}^2 - \tfrac{1}{3} \par{-\tfrac{1}{2}}^3} \nl

    We now present problem-solving guidelines for calculating the area between curves. 
    Keep in mind that in many problems, integration with either \(x\) or \(y\) is possible.
    In these cases, using either yields the same area.

    you decide how to execute the integration.

        To sketch the curves, we note that \(x = 5 - y^2\) has a vertex at \((5, 0).\)
        As \(y\) increases, the graph arches through the first quadrant 
        and hits the \(y\)-axis sometime after \(y = 2.\)
        To find when \(y = 1 + x\) intersects \(x = 5 - y^2,\)
        we express both functions in terms of one common variable.
        For example, we rearrange the former equation to get \(x = y - 1;\) then we find 
        \[
        \ba 
        y - 1 &= 5 - y^2 \nl 
        y^2 + y - 6 &= 0 \nl 
        (y + 3)(y - 2) &= 0 \nl 
        \implies y &= -3 \cma y = 2 \pd
        \ea 
        \] 
        Thus, in the first quadrant the line \(y = 1 + x\) crosses the parabola at \((1, 2).\)
        The line \(y = 1\) hits the parabola at the point \((4, 1).\)
        We therefore obtain the sketch in <a href="#areas-between-curves-hybrid">Figure 10</a>.

        <span class="label-emph">Integrating with \(y\)</span>
        It is easier to integrate with \(y\)  
        because for all \(y\) in the region, the function \(x = 5 - y^2\) is to the right of the line \(y = 1 + x.\)
        This means that the boundaries of the region remain the same.
        We therefore commit to integrating with \(y,\) so we must express all functions and bounds using \(y.\)
        We write the latter equation as \(x = y - 1.\)
        The region goes from \(y = 1\) to \(y = 2;\) thus, \(\eqrefer{eq:area-y}\) gives 
        \[
        \ba 
        A &= \int_1^2 \parbr{(5 - y^2) - (y - 1)} \di y \nl 
        &= \int_1^2 \par{6 - y - y^2} \di y \nl 
        &= \par{6y - \tfrac{1}{2} y^2 - \tfrac{1}{3} y^3} \intEval_1^2 \nl 
        &= \parbr{6(2) - \tfrac{1}{2}(2)^2 - \tfrac{1}{3}(2)^3} 
        - \parbr{6(1) - \tfrac{1}{2}(1)^2 - \tfrac{1}{3}(1)^3} \nl 
        &= \boxed{\tfrac{13}{6}}
        \ea 
        \]

        For \(0 \leq x \leq 1,\) the region's upper boundary is \(y = 1 + x\) 
        and its lower boundary is \(y = 1.\)
        But for \(1 \leq x \leq 4,\) the upper boundary changes to \(x = 5 - y^2.\)
        Since these boundary functions are different, we must split the region at \(x = 1\)
        and add the areas of each region.
        Using \(\eqref{eq:area-x},\) the area of the left region is given by 
        \[\int_0^1 \parbr{(1 + x) - 1} \di x \pd\]
        To find the area to the right of \(x = 1,\) 
        we rewrite \(x = 5 - y^2\) as \(y = \sqrt{5 - x}.\)
        We then have 
        \[\int_1^4 \par{\sqrt{5 - x} - 1} \di x \pd\]
        So the total area is 
        \[A = \int_0^1 \parbr{(1 + x) - 1} \di x + \int_1^4 \par{\sqrt{5 - x} - 1} \di x \pd\]
        This integral setup also delivers the answer \(A = \boxed{13/6}.\)

        We obtain the sketch in <a href="#areas-between-curves-hybrid2">Figure 11</a>. 
        The parabola intersects \(x = 2 - y\) at \((1, 1)\)
        and crosses \(y = 4\) at \((2, 4).\) 
        We now decide whether to cut the region vertically (integrating with \(x\))
        or horizontally (integrating with \(y\)). 
        In either case, we need to split the region
        and express all equations in terms of the respective variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="label-emph">Integrating with \(x\)</span>
        For \(0 \leq x \leq 1,\) the upper boundary is \(y = 4\)
        and the lower boundary is \(x = 2 - y.\)
        Yet for \(1 \leq x \leq 2,\) the upper boundary is \(y = 4\)
        but the lower boundary is \(y = x^2.\)
        Thus, we divide the region at \(x = 1\)
        and use \(\eqref{eq:area-x}\) to calculate the area of each subregion.
        Our next goal is to express all equations in terms of \(x.\)
        Solving for \(y\) in \(x = 2 - y\) gives \(y = 2 - x.\)
        Our area is therefore the sum
        \[A = \int_0^1 \parbr{4 - (2 - x)} \di x + \int_1^2 \par{4 - x^2} \di x \pd\]
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="label-emph">Integrating with \(y\)</span>
        If we integrate horizontally, then we need to be aware for any shifts in the region's boundaries. 
        The shaded region for \(1 \leq y \leq 2\) is bounded right by \(y = x^2\) and left by \(x = 2 - y.\)
        But for \(2 \leq y \leq 4,\) the right boundary is \(y = x^2\) and the left boundary changes to the line \(x = 0.\)
        Thus, we split the region at \(y = 2\) and take the area of each subregion. 
        Solving for \(x\) in \(y = x^2\) yields \(x = \sqrt y.\) 
        Then using \(\eqref{eq:area-y}\) for each, we get 
        \[A = \int_1^2 \parbr{\sqrt y - (2 - y)} \di y + \int_2^4 \par{\sqrt y - 0} \di y \pd \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Either integral setup supplies the answer of \(A = \boxed{25/6}.\)
        Thus, identify your options when choosing to integrate. 
        When integrating with either \(x\) or \(y\) is convenient, 
        be creative and use the method with which you feel most comfortable.
