        A triangle has sides of lengths \(a\) and \(b,\)
        and the angle between them is \(\theta\) 
        (<a href="#optimization-triangle">Figure 13</a>).
        The area of the triangle is 
        \[A = \tfrac{1}{2} ab \sin \theta \pd\]
        Using calculus, show that the area is maximized when \(\theta = 90 \degree.\)

        We differentiate \(A\) with respect to \(\theta\) to obtain 
        \[A'(\theta) = \tfrac{1}{2} a b \cos \theta \pd\]
        The domain of \(A\) is \(0 \degree \leq \theta \leq 180 \degree;\) 
        we find \(A'(\theta) = 0\) when \(\theta = 90 \degree.\)
        For \(0 \lt \theta \lt 90 \degree,\) \(A' \gt 0;\)
        for \(90 \degree \lt \theta \lt 180 \degree,\) \(A' \lt 0.\)
        Thus, the First Derivative Test asserts that \(A\) has a 
        <i>relative maximum</i> when \(\theta = 90 \degree\) 
        because at that point \(A'\) switches sign from positive to negative. 
        At the endpoints—\(\theta = 0 \degree\) and \(\theta = 180 \degree\)—the triangle collapses into a line, 
        and so \(A = 0.\)
        We therefore conclude that \(\theta = 90 \degree\) corresponds to the <i>absolute</i> maximum of \(A,\) 
        as requested.
        This problem shows that arranging two sides perpendicular to each other 
        maximizes the area of the corresponding triangle.

        Let \(x\) and \(y\) be the two numbers.
        We want to find the maximum of 
        \begin{equation}  
        P = xy \pd \label{eq:sum-30-prod}
        \end{equation}
        We have 
        \begin{equation} 
        x + y = 30 \cma \label{eq:sum-30-sum}
        \end{equation}
        from which we solve for one variable—for example, \(y = 30 - x.\)
        We substitute this expression into \(\eqRefer{eq:sum-30-prod}\)
        to express \(P\) solely in terms of \(x \col\)
        \[P = x(30 - x) = 30x - x^2 \pd\]
        We now find the critical numbers of \(P\) by equating \(P'(x) = 0.\)
        We find 
        \[
        \ba 
        P'(x) = 30 - 2x &amp;= 0 \nl 
        \implies x &amp;= 15 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        We see \(P' \gt 0\) for \(x \lt 15\) 
        and \(P' \lt 0\) for \(x \gt 15.\)
        Thus, the First Derivative Test asserts that \(x = 15\) corresponds to a <i>relative</i> maximum of \(P.\)
        Because \(\lim_{x \to -\infty} P = -\infty\) and \(\lim_{x \to \infty} P = -\infty,\)
        \(P\) needs to have a maximum value, which must occur when \(x = 15.\)
        We therefore conclude that \(x = 15\) corresponds to the <i>absolute</i> maximum of \(P.\)
        When \(x = 15,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:sum-30-sum}\) gives \(y = 15.\)
        The two numbers therefore are \(\boxed{15}\) and \(\boxed{15}.\)

        If \(x\) and \(y\) represent the two numbers, then we want to minimize 
        \begin{equation} 
        P = xy \pd \label{eq:diff-20-prod} 
        \end{equation}
        We have 
        \begin{equation} 
        x - y = 20 \cma \label{eq:diff-20-diff}
        \end{equation}
        so \(y = x - 20.\) We plug this expression into \(\eqRefer{eq:diff-20-prod}\) to obtain 
        \[P = x(x - 20) = x^2 - 20x \pd \]
        This expression only contains terms of \(x,\) so we can now differentiate: 
        \[P'(x) = 2x - 20 \pd\]
        We seek the critical numbers of \(P,\)
        so solving \(P'(x) = 0\) yields \(x = 10.\)
        If we visualize the graph of \(y = P(x),\)
        then we imagine an upward-opening parabola with an <i>absolute minimum</i> at \(x = 10.\)
        Then \(\eqRefer{eq:diff-20-diff}\) gives \(y = -10.\)
        We therefore conclude that the two numbers are 
        \(\boxed{-10}\) and \(\boxed{10}.\)

        Let the numbers be \(x\) and \(y.\) We have two equations: 
        \begin{align} 
        x + y &amp;= 10 \label{eq:sum-10-10} \nl 
        S &amp;= x^2 + y^2 \pd \label{eq:sum-10-S}
        \end{align}
        We want to minimize \(S.\)
        We first express \(S\) solely in terms of one variable—say, \(x.\)
        From \(\eqRefer{eq:sum-10-10},\) we find \(y = 10 - x.\)
        We plug this expression into \(\eqRefer{eq:sum-10-S}\) to obtain 
        \[S = x^2 + (10 - x)^2 = 2x^2 - 20x + 100 \pd\]
        Differentiating, we find 
        \[S'(x) = 4x - 20 \pd\]
        At \(x = 5,\) \(S\) has a <i>relative minimum</i>  
        because 
        \[
        \ba 
        S'(x) &amp;\lt 0 \for x \lt 5 \nl
        S'(x) &amp;\gt 0 \for x \gt 5 \pd
        \ea

        Also, \(\lim_{x \to -\infty} S = \infty\) and \(\lim_{x \to \infty} S = \infty,\)
        so \(x = 5\) must correspond to an <i>absolute</i> minimum of \(S.\)
        Then \(\eqRefer{eq:sum-10-10}\) gives \(y = 5,\) and the smallest possible sum is 
        \[S = 5^2 + 5^2 = \boxed{50}\]

        Let \(x\) and \(y\) be the numbers.
        We have 
        \begin{equation} 
        xy = 14 \cma \label{eq:14-p}
        \end{equation}
        and we want to minimize 
        \begin{equation} 
        S = x + y \pd \label{eq:14-s}
        \end{equation}
        To express \(S\) in terms one variable, 
        we use \(\eqRefer{eq:14-p}\) to get \(y = 14/x.\)
        Then, substituting this expression into \(\eqRefer{eq:14-s},\) we have  
        \begin{equation} 
        S = x + \frac{14}{x} \pd \label{eq:14-s-x}
        \end{equation}
        Differentiating \(\eqRefer{eq:14-s-x}\) yields
        \[S'(x) = 1 - \frac{14}{x^2} \cma\]
        and we find a positive critical number of \(x = \sqrt{14}.\)
        For \(x \lt \sqrt{14},\) \(S' \lt 0;\) for \(x \gt \sqrt{14},\) \(S' \gt 0.\)
        Thus, \(x = \sqrt{14}\) corresponds to a <i>relative minimum</i> of \(S.\)
        The number \(x\) is given to be positive and so it must lie in \((0, \infty).\)
        At the ends of this interval, from \(\eqRefer{eq:14-s-x}\) we see 
        \[\lim_{x \to 0^+} S = \infty \and \lim_{x \to \infty} S = \infty \pd\]
        Thus, \(x = \sqrt{14}\) must correspond to the <i>absolute minimum</i> of \(S.\)
        Then \(\eqRefer{eq:14-p}\) gives \(y = 14/\sqrt{14} = \sqrt{14}.\)
        The smallest possible sum is therefore
        \[S = \sqrt{14} + \sqrt{14} = \boxed{2\sqrt{14}}\]

        where \(h\) is measured in inches from the top of the cup.

        Note that the cup is \(9\) inches tall because the domain of \(b(h)\) in context is \(0 \leq h \leq 9.\)
        The absolute <i>minimum</i> of \(b\) is obtained at the endpoints
        because \(b(0) = b(9) = 0.\)
        We now locate the critical numbers of \(b\) by letting \(b'(h) = 0 \col \)
        \[
        \ba 
        b'(h) = \frac{81 - 2h^2}{\sqrt{81 - h^2}} &amp;= 0 \nl 
        \implies h &amp;= \frac{9}{\sqrt{2}} \pd

        We note the following:

        for \(9/\sqrt{2} \lt h \lt 9,\) \(b' \lt 0.\)
        Thus, \(h = 9/\sqrt{2}\) corresponds to a relative <i>maximum</i> of \(b;\)
        in fact, it corresponds to the <i>absolute</i> maximum. 
        We therefore conclude that the number of Tapioca balls is greatest at a distance of 
        \(9/\sqrt{2} \approx 6.364\) inches from the top of the cup.

        The fisherman wants to fish in the area in which the density of salmon is highest.
        Thus, we want to maximize \(\rho(r).\)
        Its derivative is 
        \[\rho'(r) = 400r e^{-4r} - 800r^2 e^{-4r} \pd\]
        Letting \(\rho'(r) = 0,\) we find \(r = 0\) and \(r = 0.5.\)
        At \(r = 0,\) \(\rho'(r)\) does not change sign, 
        so \(\rho\) does not have an extremum there. 
        At \(r = 0.5,\) \(\rho'(r)\) switches sign from positive to negative; 
        thus, \(r = 0.5\) corresponds to a <i>relative</i> maximum of \(\rho.\)
        The domain of \(\rho\) is \(0 \leq r \lt \infty.\)
        We see \(\rho(0) = 0,\) so the fisherman should not fish at \(r = 0.\)
        To consider \(\rho\) as \(r \to \infty,\) we use L'Hôpital's rule to find   
        \[
        \ba 
        \lim_{r \to \infty} \rho(r) &amp;= \lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{200r^2}{e^{4r}} \nl 
        &amp;= \lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{400r}{4e^{4r}} \nl 
        &amp;= \lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{400}{16e^{4r}} \nl 
        &amp;= 0 \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        Thus, \(\rho\) has its <i>absolute</i> maximum when \(r = 0.5.\)
        The fisherman therefore should fish at a distance of \(\boxed{0.5 \un{meter}}\) from the shoreline.

        A uniform, thin rod of length \(30\) centimeters is pivoted at a point \(x\) centimeters from its center of gravity as it oscillates 
        (see <a href="#optimization-physical-pendulum">Figure 14</a>). 
        This device is called a <b>physical pendulum</b>. 
        The equation for its period, the time it takes to complete one full revolution, in seconds, is 
        \[T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{(0.01x)^2 + 0.3^2/12}{9.8(0.01x)}} \pd \]

        If \(f(x)\) has an extremum at \(x = a,\) then \(\sqrt{f(x)}\) also has an extremum at \(x = a.\)
        Thus, we choose to minimize \(T^2\) because its derivative is easier to compute. 
        Let \(q(x) = T^2.\) Then  
        \[q'(x) = \frac{4 \pi^2}{9.8(0.01)} \par{(0.01)^2 - \frac{(0.3)^2}{12x^2}} \pd\]
        We find \(q'(x) = 0\) when \(x = \sqrt{\frac{(0.3)^2}{12(0.01)^2}},\) whose value is approximately \(8.66 \un{cm}.\)
        We now consider extreme values of \(x \col\)
        We see \(\lim_{x \to 0^+} T = \infty\) and \(\lim_{x \to \infty} T = \infty.\)
        Thus, \(x = \boxed{8.66 \un{cm}}\) minimizes the period of the physical pendulum.

        We must maximize \(I.\)
        Differentiating gives 
        \[\deriv{I}{x} = k \par{\frac{-2}{x^3} + \frac{2}{(8 - x)^3}} \pd\]
        We solve for \(\textDeriv{I}{x} = 0,\) as follows:
        \[
        \ba 
        k \par{\frac{-2}{x^3} + \frac{2}{(8 - x)^3}} &amp;= 0 \nl 
        \frac{2}{x^3} &amp;= \frac{2}{(8 - x)^3} \nl 
        x^3 &amp;= (8 - x)^3 \nl  
        x &amp;= 4 \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        The sign of \(\textDeriv{I}{x}\) switches from negative to positive when \(x = 4,\)
        so this value corresponds to a <i>relative minimum</i> of \(I.\)
        We want to maximize \(I,\) so we have no further consideration of this extremum. 
        The domain of \(I\) is \(0 \lt x \lt 8;\) we see 
        \[\lim_{x \to 0^+} I = \infty \qquad \lim_{x \to 8^-} I = \infty \pd\]
        Thus, sound intensity is maximized at either \(x = 0\) or \(x = 8.\)
        The dancer therefore should stand right next to either speaker.

        Drawing a sketch, we call \(\ell\) the pen's length and \(w\) pen's width. 
        The perimeter is \(2w + \ell\) and must equal \(24 \col\)
        \begin{equation} 
        2w + \ell = 24 \pd \label{eq:pen-p} 
        \end{equation}
        Our goal is to maximize 
        \begin{equation}  
        A = w \ell \cma \label{eq:pen-a}
        \end{equation}
        which we express in terms of one variable. 
        From \(\eqRefer{eq:pen-p},\) we find \(\ell = 24 - 2w.\)
        We substitute this expression into \(\eqRefer{eq:pen-a}\) to obtain 
        \begin{equation} 
        A = w(24 - 2w) = 24w - 2w^2 \pd \label{eq:pen-Aw}
        \end{equation}
        Since \(A\) is now expressed in terms of \(w,\) 
        we differentiate to find 
        \[A'(w) = 24 - 4w \pd\]
        At \(w = 6\) we find a critical point of \(A.\)
        For \(w \lt 6,\) \(A' \gt 0;\) for \(w \gt 6,\) \(A' \lt 0.\)
        Thus, \(w = 6\) corresponds to a <i>relative</i> maximum of \(A.\)
        The question is now whether \(w = 6\) corresponds to the <i>absolute</i> maximum of \(A.\)
        And it does, because the domain of \(A\) is \(0 \leq w \leq 12;\)
        at each endpoint \(A = 0\) by \(\eqRefer{eq:pen-Aw}.\)
        Then \(\eqRefer{eq:pen-p}\) gives \(\ell = 24 - 2(6) = 12,\)
        meaning the pen's area is maximized by instating a width of \(6 \un{feet}\) 
        and length of \(12 \un{feet}.\)
        The area is then 
        \[6 \un{ft} \cdot 12 \un{ft} = \boxed{72 \un{ft}^2}\]

        Let \((x, y)\) be a point on the line. 
        The horizontal distance from \((x, y)\) to \((4, 3)\) is \(4 - x.\)
        The vertical distance between \((x, y)\) and \((4, 3)\) is \(y - 3.\)
        Thus, the distance from the point to the line is 
        \begin{equation} 
        d = \sqrt{(4 - x)^2 + (y - 3)^2} \pd \label{eq:line-distance}
        \end{equation}
        We want to express \(d\) entirely in terms of one variable, \(x.\)
        Since \(y = 2x,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:line-distance}\) becomes 
        \[d = \sqrt{(4 - x)^2 + (2x - 3)^2} \cma\]
        the expression we want to minimize. 
        The critical numbers of \(d\) and \(d^2\) are the same, 
        so for simplicity we find the critical numbers of \(d^2.\)
        Let \(q(x) = d^2;\) then 
        \[q'(x) = -2(4 - x) + 4(2x - 3) \pd\]
        We solve \(q'(x) = 0,\) finding \(x = 2.\)
        Since \(q'\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(x = 2,\)
        this value corresponds to a <i>relative minimum</i> of \(q\) (and, therefore, of \(d\)).
        The domain of \(q\) is \(-\infty \lt x \lt \infty;\)
        as \(x\) approaches each endpoint, \(q \to \infty.\)
        Thus, \(x = 2\) must be the <i>absolute</i> minimum of \(q\) (and, hence, of \(d\)).
        Then \(y = 2(2) = 4,\) so the point \(\boxed{(2, 4)}\) on the line is closest to \((4, 3).\)

        We label each side of the tank's square base as \(x.\)
        Also let \(y\) be the tank's height.
        The tank's volume is then 
        \begin{equation} 
        x^2 y = 2000 \pd \label{eq:tank-V}
        \end{equation}
        The tank has an open top, so its surface area is  
        \begin{equation} 
        S = x^2 + 4xy \cma \label{eq:tank-S}
        \end{equation}
        the expression we wish to minimize. 
        From \(\eqRefer{eq:tank-V},\) we obtain \(y = 2000/x^2.\)
        Substituting this expression into \(\eqRefer{eq:tank-S}\) then produces 
        \[S = x^2 + 4x \par{\frac{2000}{x^2}}= x^2 + \frac{8000}{x} \pd\]
        Differentiating gives 
        \[S'(x) = 2x - \frac{8000}{x^2} \pd\]
        We solve \(S'(x) = 0,\) as follows:
        \[
        \ba 
        2x - \frac{8000}{x^2} &amp;= 0 \nl 
        2x^3 &amp;= 8000 \nl 
        x &amp;= \sqrt[3]{4000} \approx 15.87 \un{cm} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        Then \(y = 2000/(15.87)^2 \approx 7.94 \un{cm}.\)
        Thus, the tank should be \(15.87 \un{cm}\) by \(15.87 \un{cm}\) by \(7.94 \un{cm}.\)

        Let \(r\) be the can's radius and \(h\) be its height. 
        The volume of the can is 
        \begin{equation} 
        \pi r^2 h = 500 \pd \label{eq:can-volume}
        \end{equation}
        The surface area is 
        \begin{equation} 
        S = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h \pd \label{eq:can-S}
        \end{equation}
        (To remember this formula, note that the cylinder's bases are circles of area \(\pi r^2.\) 
        The cylinder is wrapped by a rectangular sheet of area \(2 \pi rh.\))
        In \(\eqRefer{eq:can-volume}\) we get \(h = 500/(\pi r^2),\) 
        which we plug into \(\eqRefer{eq:can-S}\) to get 
        \[S = 2\pi r^2 + \frac{1000}{r} \pd\]
        Differentiating gives 
        \[S'(r) = 4 \pi r - \frac{1000}{r^2} \cma\]
        and the solution to \(S'(r) = 0\) is \(r = \sqrt[3]{250/\pi}\) \(\approx 4.301 \un{in}.\)
        You may verify that \(r = \sqrt[3]{250/\pi}\) corresponds to a <i>relative</i> minimum of \(S.\)
        Also note that \(\lim_{r \to 0^+} S = \infty\) and \(\lim_{r \to \infty} S = \infty.\)
        Thus, \(r = \sqrt[3]{250/\pi}\) must correspond to the <i>absolute</i> minimum of \(S.\)
        Then \(h \approx 8.602 \un{in}.\)
        We conclude that the cylinder should have radius \(4.301 \un{in}\) and height \(8.602 \un{in}.\)

        We seek the maximum possible area of the window. 
        Sketching the problem, we let \(r\) be the semicircle's radius 
        and \(h\) be the rectangle's height. 
        Also note that the rectangle's length is \(2r.\)
        The equation for the perimeter is then  
        \begin{equation} 
        4r + 2h + \pi r = 16 \pd \label{eq:window-P}

        We want to maximize 
        \begin{equation} 
        A = 2r h + \tfrac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \pd \label{eq:window-A}
        \end{equation}
        To express \(A\) in terms of one variable, 
        we use \(\eqRefer{eq:window-P}\) to get 
        \begin{equation} 
        h = 8 - \tfrac{1}{2}r(4 + \pi) \pd \label{eq:window-h}
        \end{equation}
        Plugging this expression into \(\eqRefer{eq:window-A}\) then yields 
        \[

        A &amp;= 2r \par{8 - \tfrac{1}{2}r(4 + \pi)} + \tfrac{1}{2} \pi  r^2 \nl

        Differentiating, we find 
        \[A'(r) = 16 - 2r \par{4 + \tfrac{\pi}{2}} \pd\]
        We want the critical numbers of \(A,\) so we let \(A'(r) = 0 \col\)
        \[16 - 2r\par{4 + \tfrac{\pi}{2}} = 0 \implies r = \frac{8}{4 + \frac{\pi}{2}} \pd\]
        The numerical value of \(r\) is roughly \(1.436 \un{m}.\)
        Then the rectangle's length is \(2r \approx 2.872 \un{m},\)

        We first determine the area of the trough's trapezoidal face. 
        This trapezoid has two triangles and a square.
        Each triangle has area \(\tfrac{1}{2} \sin \theta \cos \theta,\)
        and the square has area \(1 \cdot \cos \theta.\)
        Thus, the area of the trapezoidal face is 
        \[
        \ba 
        A &amp;= 2 \par{\tfrac{1}{2} \sin \theta \cos \theta} + \cos \theta \nl 
        &amp;= \sin \theta \cos \theta + \cos \theta \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        We use the identity \(\sin \theta \cos \theta = \tfrac{1}{2} \sin 2 \theta\) to obtain 
        \[
        A = \tfrac{1}{2} \sin 2 \theta + \cos \theta \pd \label{eq:trough-A}
        \]
        The trough's volume is then 
        \begin{equation} 
        V = (\tfrac{1}{2} \sin 2 \theta + \cos \theta) \, L \pd \label{eq:trough-V}
        \end{equation}
        Differentiating \(\eqRefer{eq:trough-V}\) yields 
        \begin{equation} 
        V'(\theta) = L(\cos 2 \theta - \sin \theta) \pd \label{eq:trough-V'}
        \end{equation}
        We locate the critical numbers of \(V\) by letting \(V'(\theta) = 0.\) 
        We want to write \(V'(\theta)\) entirely in terms of one trigonometric 
        function—the simplest being sine.
        Combining the double-angle identity for cosine with the Pythagorean Identity, we find  
        \[
        \ba

        \(\eqRefer{eq:trough-V'}\) then becomes 
        \[V'(\theta) = L(1 - 2 \sin^2 \theta - \sin \theta) \pd\]
        We equate this expression to \(0,\) finding 
        \[-2 \sin^2 \theta - \sin \theta + 1 = 0 \cma\]
        from which we get 
        \[\sin \theta = \tfrac{1}{2} \qquad \sin \theta = -1 \pd\]
        In the first case \(\theta = \pi/6.\)
        The second case yields \(\theta = 3\pi/2,\) a clear extraneous solution in this context—and so we discard it.
        We note that \(V'\) changes sign from positive to negative when \(\theta = \pi/6,\)
        so this value corresponds to a relative maximum of \(V.\)
        The domain of \(V\) is \(0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2,\)
        and at each endpoint the trough collapses into a straight line.
        So we conclude that \(\theta = \boxed{\pi/6}\) corresponds to the <i>absolute maximum</i>
        of \(V,\) maximizing the volume of the trough.

        Let \((x, y)\) be one vertex of the rectangle.
        Then the mirror vertex is \((-x, y)\) and so the rectangle's area is 
        \begin{equation} 
        A = 2xy \pd \label{eq:rectangle-area}
        \end{equation}
        But \(y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2},\) so \(\eqRefer{eq:rectangle-area}\) becomes

        A = 2x \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} \pd \label{eq:rectangle-area-x}

        We differentiate \(\eqRefer{eq:rectangle-area-x}\) to get 
        \[A'(x) = 2 \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} \pd\]
        Solving \(A'(x) = 0\) gives \(x = r/\sqrt 2,\)
        which corresponds to a <i>relative maximum</i> of \(A\) because 
        \(A'\) changes sign from positive to negative at that value.
        At the endpoints—\(x = 0\) and \(x = r\)—the rectangle collapses into a line, and therefore has area \(0.\)
        We then conclude that \(x = r/\sqrt 2\) corresponds to the <i>absolute maximum</i> of \(A.\)
        Then the area, by \(\eqRefer{eq:rectangle-area-x},\) is 
        \[2 \par{\frac{r}{\sqrt 2}} \sqrt{r^2 - \par{\frac{r}{\sqrt 2}}^2} = \boxed{r^2}\]
        Thus, the maximum possible area of an inscribed rectangle is \(r^2.\)

        The trapezoid has a rectangle and two triangles.
        The rectangle's area is \(2xy,\) and each triangle's area is \(\tfrac{1}{2}(2 - x)y.\)
        And \(y = \sqrt{4 - x^2},\) so the trapezoid's area is

        The solution to \(A'(x) = 0\) is \(a/\sqrt 2,\)

</figure>
        We draw a sketch of the situation. 
        The squares in each corner of the sheet have side lengths \(x.\)
        The resulting folded up box then has length \((15 - 2x),\) width \((20 - 2x),\) and height \(x.\)
        Its volume is then 
        \begin{equation} 
        V = x(15 - 2x)(20 - 2x) = 4x^3 - 70x^2 + 300x \pd \label{eq:box-v}
        \end{equation}
        Differentiating gives 
        \[V'(x) = 12x^2 - 140x + 300 \cma\]
        and the solutions to \(V'(x) = 0\) are \(x \approx 2.829\) and \(x \approx 8.838.\)
        The latter solution causes one side of the box to be negative, so we scrap it.
        You may also verify that \(x = 2.829\) corresponds to a <i>relative</i> maximum of \(V.\)
        The domain of \(V\) is \(0 \leq x \leq 15/2,\) and at the endpoints \(V = 0.\)
        Thus, \(x = 2.829\) must correspond to the <i>absolute</i> maximum of \(V.\)
        We conclude that squares of length \(\boxed{2.829 \un{inches}}\) 
        should be cut from the box's corners.
        \(\eqRefer{eq:box-v}\) gives the maximum volume to be

        Let \(x\) represent the distance from Dani to Hena's original position. 
        Let \(y\) be Hena's distance from her original position. 
        Hena jogs at \(6\) miles per hour; 
        if \(t\) is time in hours, then \(y = 6t.\)
        Dani starts two miles due east of Hena's original position and jogs at \(8\) miles per hour, 
        so \(x = 2 - 8t.\)
        The distance between the girls is then 
        \[d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(2 - 8t)^2 + (6t)^2} \pd\]
        We need to minimize \(d,\) but it is easier to minimize \(d^2.\)
        Let \(q(t) = d^2.\) 
        Then 
        \[q'(t) = -16(2 - 8t) + 12(6t) \pd\]
        Solving \(q'(t) = 0\) shows 
        \[t = \frac{32}{12(6) + 16(8)} = 0.16 \pd\]
        The domain of \(q\) is \(t \geq 0.\)
        We find \(q(0) = 4\) and \(q(0.16) = 1.44.\)
        Also, \(\lim_{t \to \infty} q = \infty.\)
        We therefore are convinced that \(t = 0.16\) corresponds to the <i>absolute</i> minimum of \(q.\)
        And \(0.16\) hour is \(0.16 \cdot 60 = 9.6\) minutes,

        Let \(x\) be the distance from the intersection to car B, 
        and let \(y\) be the distance between the intersection and car A. 
        Since car A travels at \(45\) miles per hour, 
        its distance function with respect to time is \(y = 55t\) 
        (where \(t\) is in hours after \(3\) <span class="time">pm</span>). 
        To write car B's distance function, we note that the car approaches the intersection 
        one hour <i>after</i> <span class="time">3 pm</span>. 
        We therefore write \(x = 55 - 55t.\)
        The Pythagorean Theorem gives the distance function to be  
        \[d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(45t)^2 + (55 - 55t)^2} \pd\]
        We need to minimize \(d,\) but for convenience we choose to minimize \(d^2\) 
        because both functions have the same critical numbers. 
        Let \(q(t) = d^2;\) then 
        \[q'(t) = 90(45t) - 110(55 - 55t) \pd\]
        Solving \(q'(t) = 0\) gives 
        \[t = \frac{110(55)}{90(45) + 110(55)} = 0.599 \pd\]
        The domain of \(q\) is \(t \geq 0.\)
        Using a calculator, we find \(q(0) = 3025\) and \(q(0.599) = 1212.995.\)
        Also, \(\lim_{t \to \infty} q = \infty.\)
        This analysis asserts that \(t = 0.599\) must correspond to the 
        <i>absolute</i> minimum of \(q\) (and, therefore, of \(d\)).
        Since \(0.599\) hour is \(0.599 \cdot 60 = 35.94\) minutes, 
        we conclude that the cars are closest together at \(\boxed{\text{3:36}}\) <span class="time">pm</span>.

        A = \tfrac{1}{2} bh \pd \label{eq:line-area}
        \end{equation}
        Drawing a picture, we label two points: \((0, h)\) and \((b, 0).\)
        We write the preliminary equation for the line as 
        \begin{equation} 
        y - 4 = m(x - 1) \pd \label{eq:line-line}
        \end{equation}
        We want to express \(\eqRefer{eq:line-area}\) 
        in terms of the slope \(m,\) which we vary to minimize \(A.\)
        The \(y\)-intercept is \((0, h);\) 
        plugging this point into \(\eqRefer{eq:line-line}\) then shows 
        \[h - 4 = m(0 - 1) \implies h = 4 - m \pd\]
        The \(x\)-intercept is \((b, 0),\) from which \(\eqRefer{eq:line-line}\) provides 
        \[0 - 4 = m(b - 1) \implies b = 1 - \tfrac{4}{m} \pd\]
        Now we express \(\eqRefer{eq:line-area}\) in terms of the slope, \(m \col\)
        \[
        \ba 
        A &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \par{1 - \frac{4}{m}} (4 - m) \nl

        We differentiate to get 
        \[
        A'(m) = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{8}{m^2} \pd 
        \]
        Solving \(A'(m) = 0,\) we find \(m = -4\) and \(m = 4.\)
        We discard the latter solution because the slope is given to be negative.
        The domain of \(A\) is \(m \lt 0.\)
        We see \(\lim_{m \to -\infty} A = \infty,\)
        so \(A\) must have an absolute minimum—and it must occur when \(m = -4.\)
        The equation of the line is, from \(\eqRefer{eq:line-line},\) 
        \[y - 4 = -4(x - 1) \or \boxed{y = -4x + 8}\]
        Then \(A = 8.\)

        The power station must be placed between towers A and B to minimize the amount of wiring.
        Let \(x\) be the horizontal distance between tower A and the power station. 
        Then \(45 - x\) is the horizontal distance between tower B and the power station. 
        The total amount of wire is then 
        \[
        \ba 
        d &amp;= d_1 + d_2 \nl 
        &amp;= \sqrt{x^2 + 30^2} + \sqrt{(45 - x)^2 + 22^2} \pd

        We differentiate to find 
        \[d'(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 900}} + \frac{x - 45}{\sqrt{x^2 - 90x + 2509}} \pd\]
        Using a calculator, the solution to \(d'(x) = 0\) is \(x = 675/26.\)
        This value corresponds to the <i>absolute minimum</i> of \(d;\)
        thus, the station should be placed \(675/26 \approx 25.962 \un{ft}\)
        east of tower A.

        Let \(w\) be the poster's width and \(\ell\) be the poster's length. 
        Since the poster must have \(100\) square inches of display area,
        we write 
        \begin{equation} 
        (w - 2)(\ell - 4) = 100 \pd \label{eq:poster-area}
        \end{equation}
        We want to minimize the <i>perimeter</i>,  
        \begin{equation} 
        P = 2w + 2 \ell \pd \label{eq:poster-perimeter}
        \end{equation}
        From \(\eqRefer{eq:poster-area}\) we solve for one variable—say, \(\ell.\)
        Doing so gives 
        \begin{equation} 
        \ell = 4 + \frac{100}{w - 2} \cma \label{eq:poster-length}
        \end{equation}
        which we substitute into \(\eqRefer{eq:poster-perimeter}\) to obtain 
        \begin{equation} 
        P(w) = 2w + 8 + \frac{200}{w - 2} \pd \label{eq:poster-perimeter-w}
        \end{equation}
        Differentiating \(P,\)  
        \[P'(w) = 2 - \frac{200}{(w - 2)^2} \pd\]
        Letting \(P'(w) = 0\) then yields \(w = 12,\)
        which corresponds to a <i>relative minimum</i> of \(P\) because 
        \(P'\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(w = 12.\)
        Now we test extreme values of \(w \col\)
        The domain of \(P(w)\) is \(w \gt 2.\) 
        From \(\eqRefer{eq:poster-perimeter-w},\) 
        \(\lim_{w \to 2^+} P(w) = \infty\) and \(\lim_{w \to \infty} P(w) = \infty.\)
        We therefore conclude that \(w = 12\) corresponds to the <i>absolute minimum</i> of \(P.\)
        Then \(\eqRefer{eq:poster-length}\) shows  
        \[\ell = 4 + \frac{100}{12 - 2} = 14 \pd \]
        Thus, the poster should be \(\boxed{12 \un{in}}\) by \(\boxed{14 \un{in}}.\)

        and the outfield must be \(5\) feet wide on the west and east sides of the playing field.
        The area of the playing field must be \(10000\) square feet.

</figure>
        Let \(w\) be the stadium's width and \(\ell\) be its length.
        In terms of these quantities, 
        the area of the playing field is the product of \((w - 10)\) and \((\ell - 4).\) 
        The area is given to be \(10000,\) so we have 
        \begin{equation} 
        (w - 10)(\ell - 4) = 10000 \pd \label{eq:stadium-area}
        \end{equation}
        The perimeter of the stadium is 
        \begin{equation} 
        P = 2w + 2 \ell \cma \label{eq:stadium-perimeter} 
        \end{equation}
        the quantity we want to minimize.
        From \(\eqRefer{eq:stadium-area}\) we solve for one variable—say, \(\ell.\)
        Doing so gives 
        \begin{equation} 
        \ell = 4 + \frac{10000}{w - 10} \cma \label{eq:stadium-length} 
        \end{equation}
        which we substitute into \(\eqRefer{eq:stadium-perimeter}\) to obtain 
        \[P(w) = 2w + 8 + \frac{20000}{w - 10} \pd\]
        Differentiating then gives 
        \[P'(w) = 2 - \frac{20000}{(w - 10)^2} \pd\]
        We solve \(P'(w) = 0\) for \(w \col\) 
        \[
        \ba 
        2 - \frac{20000}{(w - 10)^2} &amp;= 0 \nl 
        (w - 10)^2 &amp;= 10000 \nl 
        \implies w &amp;= 110 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        The value \(w = 110\) corresponds to a <i>relative minimum</i>
        of \(P\) because \(P'\) switches sign from negative to positive at that point. 
        The domain of \(P\) is \(w \gt 10;\)
        we observe that \(\lim_{w \to 10^+} P(w) = \infty\) and \(\lim_{w \to \infty} P(w) = \infty.\)
        Thus, we conclude that \(w = 110\) must be the location of the <i>absolute minimum</i> of \(P.\)
        Then \(\eqRefer{eq:stadium-length}\) provides 
        \[\ell = 4 + \frac{10000}{110 - 10} = 104 \pd\]
        The stadium therefore should be \(\boxed{110 \un{ft}}\) by \(\boxed{104 \un{ft}}.\)

        Let \(w\) be the cake's width and \(\ell\) be the cake's length. 
        The area without frosting has width \((w - 4)\) and length \((\ell - 4).\)
        The product of these quantities is \(284,\) so we have 
        \begin{equation} 
        (w - 4)(\ell - 4) = 284 \pd \label{eq:cake-area}
        \end{equation}
        We want to minimize the <i>perimeter</i>,
        \begin{equation} 
        P = 2w + 2 \ell \pd \label{eq:cake-perimeter}
        \end{equation}
        In \(\eqRefer{eq:cake-area}\) we solve for one variable—say, \(w.\)
        We then get 
        \begin{equation} 
        w = 4 + \frac{284}{\ell - 4} \cma \label{eq:cake-w}
        \end{equation}
        which we substitute into \(\eqRefer{eq:cake-perimeter}\) to obtain 
        \[P(\ell) = 2 \ell + 8 + \frac{568}{\ell - 4} \pd\]
        Differentiating then gives 
        \[P'(\ell) = 2 - \frac{568}{(\ell - 4)^2} \pd\]
        We now solve for \(\ell\) in \(P'(\ell) = 0,\) as follows:
        \[
        \ba 
        2 - \frac{568}{(\ell - 4)^2} &amp;= 0 \nl 
        \ell &amp;= 4 + \sqrt{284} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        This value of \(\ell\) corresponds to a <i>relative minimum</i> of \(P\)
        because \(P'\) changes sign from negative to positive at that point.
        Further note that the domain of \(P\) is \(\ell \gt 4.\)
        We find \(\lim_{\ell \to 4^+} P = \infty\) and \(\lim_{\ell \to \infty} P = \infty.\)
        This analysis asserts that \(\ell = 4 + \sqrt{284}\) corresponds to the <i>absolute</i> minimum of \(P.\)
        From \(\eqRefer{eq:cake-w},\)
        \[w = 4 + \frac{284}{(4 + \sqrt{284}) - 4} = 4 + \sqrt{284} \pd\]
        The value of \(4 + \sqrt{284}\) is roughly \(20.852,\)
        so the cake should have dimensions
        \(\boxed{20.852 \un{cm}}\) by \(\boxed{20.852 \un{cm}}.\)

        To determine the critical points of \(P,\)

        Note that \(P' \gt 0\) for \(R \lt r\) and \(P' \lt 0\)

        Thus, \(P\) has a <i>relative</i> maximum at \(R = r\) by the First-Derivative Test.
        Also observe that \(P(0) = 0\) and \(\lim_{R \to \infty} P(R) = 0,\)
        so \(P\) has an <i>absolute</i> maximum when \(R = r.\)
        The power output at this value is

        The pipe runs on land and then water. 
        Let \(x\) be the distance of pipe on land. 
        Then the distance of pipe in the water is \(\sqrt{9 + (10 - x)^2}.\)
        Since the cost of installing pipe in water is double that on land, the cost function is 
        \[C(x) = x + 2 \sqrt{9 + (10 - x)^2} \pd\]
        The derivative is

        the distance she swims is \(\sqrt{2^2 + (12 - x)^2}.\)
        Her swimming speed is \(2\) feet per second, so the time she takes to swim is

        We draw a diagram of the problem. 
        To find the area \(A\) of triangle \(\Delta PQR,\) we can double the area of one of its halves—say, \(\Delta PQS \col\)
        \begin{equation} 
        A = \par{\overline{PS}} \par{\overline{QS}} \pd \label{eq:circle-r-area} 
        \end{equation}
        We want to express \(A\) in terms of \(x\) and \(r\) (where \(r\) is constant).
        We further see that \(\overline{PS} = \overline{PO} + \overline{OS},\)
        where \(\overline{PO}\) is simply \(r.\)
        Let \(x\) be the length \(\overline{QS} = \overline{SR};\) then by the Pythagorean Theorem
        \[\overline{OS} = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} \pd\]
        Therefore, \(\eqRefer{eq:circle-r-area}\) becomes 
        \begin{equation} 
        A = x \par{r + \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} \pd \label{eq:circle-r-area-x}
        \end{equation}
        Differentiating, we obtain 
        \[\deriv{A}{x} = r + \frac{r^2 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} = 0 \pd\]
        Rearranging to solve for \(x,\) we get 
        \[
        \ba 
        \par{\frac{r^2 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}}}^2 &amp;= (-r)^2 \nl

        Our goal is to find the absolute minimum of \(F\)
        for \(0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2.\)
        Differentiating gives 
        \[
        \deriv{F}{\theta} = - \frac{\mu W}{(\mu \sin \theta + \cos \theta)^2} (\mu \cos \theta - \sin \theta) \pd
        \]
        We locate the critical points of \(F\)
        by equating the derivative to \(0,\) as follows:
        \[
        \ba
        - \frac{\mu W}{(\mu \sin \theta + \cos \theta)^2} (\mu \cos \theta - \sin \theta) &amp;= 0 \nl 
        \mu \cos \theta - \sin \theta &amp;= 0 \nl 
        \tan \theta &amp;= \mu \nl 
        \implies \theta &amp;= \atan \mu \pd
        \ea
        \]
        Note that \(\textderiv{F}{\theta} \gt 0\) when \(\mu \cos \theta - \sin \theta \lt 0\) 
        \(\implies \mu \cos \theta \lt \sin \theta\) 
        \(\implies \mu \lt \tan \theta\)
        \(\implies \theta \gt \atan \mu.\)
        Hence, \(F\) is decreasing on \([0, \atan \mu]\) and increasing on \([\atan \mu, \pi/2].\)
        Thus, \(F\) has a <i>relative</i> minimum at \(\theta = \atan \mu\)
        by the First-Derivative Test.
        Observe that the denominator of \(F,\) \(\mu \sin \theta + \cos \theta,\)
        equals \(1\) when \(\theta = 0\) and equals \(\mu\) when \(\theta = \pi/2.\)
        But when \(\theta = \atan \mu,\) the denominator becomes
        \[
        \ba
        \mu \sin \par{\atan \mu} + \cos \par{\atan \mu} &amp;= \frac{\mu^2}{\sqrt{\mu^2 + 1}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu^2 + 1}} \nl
        &amp;= \frac{\mu^2 + 1}{\sqrt{\mu^2 + 1}} \nl 
        &amp;= \sqrt{\mu^2 + 1} \cma
        \ea
        \]
        which is greater than \(1\) <i>and</i> greater than \(\mu.\)
        Thus, \(F(\atan \mu)\) is smaller than \(F(0)\) and \(F(\pi/2).\)
        Hence, \(F\) attains its <i>absolute</i> minimum when \(\boxed{\theta = \atan \mu}.\)

        \[\ell = \sqrt{x^2 + \par{3 +  2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{16}}}^2} + \sqrt{(4 - x)^2 + \par{3 +  2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{16}}}^2} \pd\]
        If we graph \(y = \ell(x),\) then we find the absolute minimum to occur when \(x = 4.\)
        Thus, the rope should be connected to a point directly above Beam B.

        In <a href="#optimization-light">Figure 16</a>,
        a ray of light starts in the air at point \(P,\)
        is refracted into a medium of water at point \(O,\) 
        and travels to point \(Q.\)
        Fermat's Principle states that the light ray follows the fastest route to point \(Q.\)
        Let \(v_1\) be the light's speed in air and \(v_2\) be its speed in water. 
        Show that 
        \[\frac{\sin \theta_1}{v_1} = \frac{\sin \theta_2}{v_2} \pd\]
        This formula is <b>Snell's Law</b>, a fundamental equation in the study of optics.

        <div class="box-solution__solution" id="solution-40"> 
            <span class="solution-text">SOLUTION</span> 
            
        Recall that \(\text{time} = \text{distance}/\text{speed}.\)
        When the light ray travels from \(P\) to \(O,\) 
        the time is 
        \[t_1 = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{v_1} \pd\]
        Likewise, traveling from \(O\) to \(Q\) takes time 
        \[t_2 = \frac{\sqrt{(\ell - x)^2 + b^2}}{v_2} \pd\]
        Then the total time is 
        \[
        \ba 
        T &amp;= t_1 + t_2 \nl 
        &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{v_1} + \frac{\sqrt{(\ell - x)^2 + b^2}}{v_2} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        Differentiating, we obtain 
        \begin{equation} 
        T'(x) = \frac{x}{v_1 \sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} - \frac{\ell - x}{v_2 \sqrt{(\ell - x)^2 + b^2}} \pd \label{eq:snell}
        \end{equation}
        We see 
        \[\sin \theta_1 = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} \qquad \sin \theta_2 = \frac{\ell - x}{\sqrt{(\ell - x)^2 + b^2}} \pd \]
        Then \(\eqRefer{eq:snell}\) becomes 
        \[T'(x) = \frac{\sin \theta_1}{v_1} - \frac{\sin \theta_2}{v_2} \pd\]
        Solving \(T'(x) = 0\) then yields 
        \[\frac{\sin \theta_1}{v_1} = \frac{\sin \theta_2}{v_2} \cma\]
        as requested. We assume that this situation confers the absolute minimum of \(T.\)
