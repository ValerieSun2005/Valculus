    It turns out that a ball in free fall produces a parabolic trajectory, 
    whereas a population of animals grows exponentially. 
    As we will learn later in this chapter, we know these systems' behaviors by analyzing their <i>differential equations</i>. 
    Differential equations are extremely powerful tools
    in science, economics, and ecology.
    We discuss the following topics:

<h4 id="defining-a-differential-equation">Defining a Differential Equation</h4>
<p>
    A <span class="emph">differential equation</span> relates 
    a function to its independent variable and derivatives.
    Generally, a differential equation in \(y\) and \(x\) 
    is some equation that includes \(x,\) \(y,\) and the derivatives of \(y.\)
    In an algebraic equation we solve for some unknown value, 
    such as solving for \(a\) in the equation \(3a - 6 = 0.\)
    Yet the solution to a <i>differential equation</i> is a <i>function</i>.
    In Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/4.1-Antidifferentiation.html">4.1</a> we discussed 
    the simplest type of differential equation:
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = f(x) \cma\]
    whose <span class="emph">general solution</span> is the function \(y = \int f(x) \di x.\)
    An <span class="emph">\(\bf n\)th-order differential equation</span> 
    includes an <nobr>\(n\)th</nobr>-order derivative as its highest-order derivative.
    For example, an example of a <i>second-order</i> differential equation is
    \[\derivOrder{y}{x}{2} + \deriv{y}{x} + 5y = 0\] 
    because the highest-order derivative has order \(2.\)
    In this chapter we focus primarily on <span class="emph">first-order differential equations</span>,
    which relate the rate of change of \(y\)—that is, \(\textderiv{y}{x}\)—to \(x\) and \(y.\)
    As an example, the first-order differential equation 
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = x + y\]
    asserts that the rate at which \(y\) changes with \(x\)
    equals the sum of \(x\) and \(y.\) 
</p>
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Particular Solutions</span>
    Recall, from Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/4.1-Antidifferentiation.html">4.1</a>, 
    that we often combine a differential equation with an <span class="emph">initial condition</span>. 
    This pair is called an <span class="emph">initial-value problem</span>.
    We may seek some function \(f(x)\) that 
    solves a differential equation while satisfying \(f \par{x_0} = y_0.\)
    Then \(f(x)\) is called a <span class="emph">particular solution</span> to that differential equation,
    and \(\par{x_0, y_0}\) is an initial condition.
</p>

<div class="example-title"> EXAMPLE 1 </div>
<div class="example">
    <div class="example-problem">  
        For constants \(A\) and \(b,\)
        show that the family of functions \(y = A \sin bx\)
        satisfies the second-order differential equation 
        \[\derivOrder{y}{x}{2} + b^2 y = 0 \pd\]

<button onclick="toggle1()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution1" class="solution">
    To verify a solution to a differential equation, 
    we find the second derivative of \(y = A \sin bx\)
    and see whether it satisfies the given equation. 
    Doing so gives  
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = Ab \cos bx \and \derivOrder{y}{x}{2} = -Ab^2 \sin bx \pd\]
    We see
    \[\underbrace{-Ab^2 \sin bx}_{\textderivOrder{y}{x}{2}} 
    + \underbrace{b^2 \par{A \sin bx}}_{b^2 y} \equalsCheck 0 \cma\]
    so \(y = A \sin bx\) is a solution.

<h4 id="slope-fields">Slope Fields</h4>
<p>
    Most differential equations are very difficult or even impossible to solve analytically. 
    Consider the first-order differential equation
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = F(x, y) \cma\]
    where \(F(x, y)\) is some expression containing \(x\) and \(y.\)
    Regardless of whether this differential equation can be solved,
    we can better understand this model by 
    drawing short line segments of slope \(F(x, y)\) at several points \((x, y).\)
    The result is a <span class="emph">slope field</span> (or <span class="emph">direction field</span>), 
    which provides the blueprint for a solution curve. 
    <a href="#slope-field-F">Figure 1A</a> shows the slope field for some differential equation 
    \(\textderiv{y}{x} = F(x, y).\)
    Each line segment indicates the direction in which a solution curve 
    travels at \((x, y).\)
    A <i>particular</i> solution curve is a graph that follows a slope field 
    and passes through some point \(\par{x_0, y_0};\)
    for example, <a href="#slope-field-F-solution-pt">Figure 1B</a>
    shows the particular solution curve \(y = f(x)\) that satisfies 
    the initial condition \(y_0 = f(x_0).\)

    So in the \(xy\)-plane, we draw a line segment of slope \(-2\)
    at the point \((0, 1).\)
    Likewise, the slope at \(B(2, -1)\) is 
    \[(2)^2 - 2(-1) = 6 \pd\]

    Lastly, the slope at \(C(2, 2)\) is

    To connect a slope field to a differential equation,

    In <a href="#slope-field-y">Figure 3</a>
    the slopes are \(0\) along the \(x\)-axis,

    Options (A) and (C) are therefore eliminated.
    The slopes aren't \(0\) along the \(y\)-axis,
    whereas the slope field for \(\textderiv{y}{x} = xy\) would contain this characteristic.
    Thus, the correct answer is option <b>(B)</b>,
    \(\textderiv{y}{x} = y.\)

    At any \((x, y),\) the slope is \(\textderiv{y}{x} = x - y.\)
    To construct a slope field, we evaluate \(\textderiv{y}{x}\) at
    several points of \((x, y).\)
    The following observations help us sketch the field:
    <ul>
        <li>
            When \(x = y,\) we see \(x - y = 0.\) 
            Thus, the slope is \(0\) at the points \((1, 1),\) \((2, 2),\) \((3, 3)\) 
            and \((-1, -1),\) \((-2, -2),\) \((-3, -3).\)
            We therefore draw short horizontal line segments at these points.
        </li>
        <li>
            When \(x\) is negative and \(y\) is positive, \(\textderiv{y}{x} = x - y \lt 0.\) 
            So the slopes are negative in the second quadrant.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the fourth quadrant, the slopes are positive because \(x\) is positive 
            and \(y\) is negative.
        </li>
        <li>
            When \(x\) is bigger than \(y,\) the slope is positive. 
            Conversely, when \(x\) is smaller than \(y,\) the slopes are negative.
        </li>
    </ul>
    We therefore attain the slope field in <a href="#slope-field-x-y">Figure 4</a>.

    we extend the curve downward and leftward 
    (according to the direction of the nearby slopes), 
    until it attains a relative minimum at \(x = 0.\)

    Most differential equations have no analytical solutions; 
    we must therefore use a method to approximate particular solutions. 
    Given a differential equation 
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = F(x, y) \cma\]
    <span class="emph">Euler's Method</span> enables us 
    to estimate a particular solution with the initial condition \(\par{x_0, y_0}\)
    by using a series of linear approximations. 
    We approximate points on the solution curve at equally spaced numbers 
    \(x_0,\) \(x_1 = x_0 + h,\) \(x_2 = x_1 + h, \dots.\) 
    We call \(h\) the <span class="emph">step size</span>,
    the amount by which we increment \(x\) as we take more and more approximation points.
    In <a href="#euler-method-curves">Figure 7</a> 
    a solution curve is approximated by the points 
    \(\par{x_0, y_0},\) \(\par{x_1, y_1},\) \(\par{x_2, y_2},\)
    \(\par{x_3, y_3},\) and \(\par{x_4, y_4}.\)
    The slope at \(\par{x_0, y_0}\) is \(F \par{x_0, y_0},\)
    so we have
    \[y_1 = y_0 + hF\par{x_0, y_0} \pd\] 
    Likewise, we observe that 
    \[y_2 = y_1 + h F \par{x_1, y_1} \pd\]
    In general, the horizontal distance between any points 
    \(\par{x_{n - 1}, y_{n - 1}}\) and \(\par{x_n, y_n}\) is the step size \(h;\)
    the vertical distance is \(hF\par{x_{n - 1}, y_{n - 1}}.\)
    Mathematically, 
    \begin{equation}
    y_n = y_{n - 1} + hF\par{x_{n - 1}, y_{n - 1}} \pd \label{eq:euler-method}
    \end{equation}
    In words, we attain each subsequent approximation for \(y\)
    by adding on the slope \(F\par{x_{n - 1}, y_{n - 1}}\)
    multiplied by the step size \(h.\) 
    Why is this useful?
    Remember that the slope \(F(x, y)\) is <i>known</i>,
    while the exact solution curve is <i>unknown</i>. 
    Euler's Method therefore enables us to approximate a solution curve 
    by using its rate of change \(F.\)
    Methodically, we begin at the point \(\par{x_0, y_0}\) 
    and proceed in the direction of the slope field. 
    After \(x\) is incremented by a distance \(h,\)
    we take the slope at the new location and traverse in that direction. 
    We repeat this process until \(x\) is some desired number. 
    Doing so gives us several points that we can plot to approximate a solution curve.
    Observe that the first step in Euler's Method is a linearization
    for \(y_1\) (see Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/2.7-Linearization-and-Differentials.html">2.7</a>).
    Decreasing the step size \(h\) allows us to sample more points,
    so the approximated solution curve better fits 
    the exact solution curve.
    (See <a href="#euler-method">Animation 1</a>.)
    This method lets computers output accurate solutions to many differential equations
    whose solutions are difficult to obtain.
    Even a spreadsheet is sufficient to use Euler's Method, 
    and many computer-algebra systems produce slope fields for us—the beauty of 
    technology in the modern world.

        <a href="#defining-a-differential-equation" class="summary-anchor">Defining a Differential Equation</a>
        A <span class="emph">differential equation</span> connects some function
        to its independent variable and derivatives—for example, 
        an equation that includes \(x,\) \(y,\) and the derivatives of \(y.\)
        The solution to a differential equation is a function.
        The simplest form of differential equation is 
        \[\deriv{y}{x} = f(x) \cma\]
        whose <span class="emph">general solution</span> is the function \(y = \int f(x) \di x.\)
        An <span class="emph">\(\bf n\)th-order differential equation</span> 
        contains an <nobr>\(n\)th</nobr>-order derivative as its highest-order derivative.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#slope-fields" class="summary-anchor">Slope Fields</a>
        To better understand a system modeled by a first-order differential equation,
        we construct a <span class="emph">slope field</span>. 
        For \(\textderiv{y}{x} = F(x, y),\)
        we draw short line segments with slope \(F(x, y)\) at several points of \((x, y).\)
        These line segments show the direction in which a slope curve travels. 
        A particular solution curve is a graph that follows the slope field 
        while passing through some point \(\par{x_0, y_0}.\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#euler's-method" class="summary-anchor">Euler's Method</a>
        If \(x_n = x_{n - 1} + h\) (where \(h\) is the <span class="emph">step size</span>)
        and \(\par{x_0, y_0}\) is an initial condition to the differential equation 
        \(\textderiv{y}{x} = F(x, y),\) 
        then <span class="emph">Euler's Method</span> gives the approximation 
        \begin{equation}
        y_n = y_{n - 1} + hF\par{x_{n - 1}, y_{n - 1}} \pd \eqlabel{eq:euler-method}
        \end{equation}
        In words, we begin at the point \(\par{x_0, y_0}\) 
        and proceed in the direction of the slope field. 
        After \(x\) is incremented by a distance \(h,\)
        we take the slope at the new location and traverse in the new direction. 
        We repeat this process until \(x\) is some desired number. 
        Doing so gives us several points that we can plot to approximate a solution curve.
