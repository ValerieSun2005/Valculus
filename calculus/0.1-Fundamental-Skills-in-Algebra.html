<h4 id="solving-equations">Solving Equations and Inequalities</h4>
<p>
    In a mathematical <i>equation</i>, 
    two quantities have the same value. 
    For example, \(3 = 2 + 1\) is a valid equation because both sides have the same value. 
    But some equations have some unknown quantity, 
    such as the equation \(2x + 5 = 7.\)
    What does \(x\) equal?
    We can manipulate equations by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing 
    a number on <i>both sides</i>.
    On both sides of \(2x + 5 = 7,\)
    subtracting \(5\) and then dividing by \(2\) yields \(2x = 2\)
    and then \(x = 1.\)
    The following guidelines generalize the strategy for solving similar equations.
    In general, the objective is to perform operations to <i>isolate</i> the variable.
</p>

<aside class="box-recall">
    A <i>variable</i> is a letter or symbol that represents an unknown number,
    and a <i>coefficient</i> is a number by which the variable is multiplied. 
    A <i>constant</i> is a number that stands alone.
    For example, in the expression \(4x + 7,\)
    the coefficient is \(4\) and the constant is \(7.\)

<div class="steps-title">SOLVING EQUATIONS WITH ONE VARIABLE</div>
<div class="steps">
    To solve for \(x\) in an equation, use the following steps:
    <ol class="list-num">

        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="label-emph">Separate</span>
            By adding or subtracting,
            gather all the variables on one side of the equation 
            and all the constants on the other side.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="label-emph">Isolate</span>
            Divide both sides by the coefficient.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="label-emph">Check</span>
            Substitute your value of \(x\) back into the equation to verify whether it is correct.

            On the left side, 
            adding \(6\) and \(10\) gives \(16.\)
            On the right side, adding \(-8x\) to \(2x\)
            yields \(-6x.\)
            Thus, the condensed equation is 
            \[3x + 16 = 7 - 6x \pd\]

        <li>

            We want to place all the <nobr>\(x\)'s</nobr> on the left

            To clear the \(-6x\) on the right, 
            we add \(6x\) to both sides; 
            to clear the \(16\) on the left, 
            we subtract \(16\) from both sides. 
            Doing so yields

        <li>
            <span class="label-emph">Isolate</span>
            The coefficient is the number by which \(x\) is multiplied—namely, \(9.\)
            To cancel out the \(9\) and therefore isolate \(x,\) 
            we divide both sides by \(9\) to get 
            \[x = \boxed{-1}\]

        <li>
            <span class="label-emph">Check</span>

            To expand \(4(x + 5),\)
            we <i>distribute</i> the \(4\)—that is, multiply each term inside the parentheses by \(4.\)
            Then the equation becomes
            \[
            \ba 
            4x + 20 - 2x &= 31 \nl

            Subtracting \(20\) from both sides yields

            \[x = \boxed{\tfrac{11}{2}}\]
            (It is also correct to write \(x = 5.5;\)
            in calculus we prefer to write fractions.)

        <li>
            <span class="label-emph">Check</span>
            Substituting \(x = 11/2\) back into the given equation, we see 
            \[

            4 \par{\tfrac{11}{2} + 5} - 2 \par{\tfrac{11}{2}} &= 31 \nl 
            (22 + 20) - 11 &= 31 \nl 
            31 &\equalsCheck 31 \pd
            \ea

            Hence, \(x = 11/2\) is the correct solution.

    An <span class="emph">inequality</span> is a mathematical statement that compares two quantities; 
    for example, \(5 \gt 4\) means \(5\) is greater than \(4.\)
    Likewise, the inequality \(x \leq 6\) means \(x\) can be <i>any number</i> that is less or equal to \(6.\)
    We solve inequalities similarly to how we solve equations,
    as shown by the following examples.

        <hr>
        <li>
            On both sides, we add \(6\) and then divide by \(-4.\)
            But when we multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, 
            <i>the inequality sign is flipped</i>. 
            So we have 
            \[-4x \leq 16 \implies \boxed{x \geq -4}\]

            We multiply both sides by \(x\) and then divide by \(7,\)
            as follows:
            \[1 \gt 7x \implies \tfrac{1}{7} \gt x \implies \boxed{x \lt \tfrac{1}{7}}\]
            (Since \(x\) is given to be positive, we don't flip the inequality sign.)

<p>
    Recall that exponents represent repeated multiplication;
    for example, \(2^3\) \(= 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\) \(= 8.\)
    Let \(a\) and \(b\) be positive numbers, 
    and let \(m\) and \(n\) be any numbers. 
    Then the <span class="emph">exponent laws</span> are as follows:
    \begin{align} 
    a^{m + n} &= a^m \, a^n \cma \label{eq:exp-law-add} \nl 
    a^{m - n} &= \frac{a^m}{a^n} \cma \label{eq:exp-law-minus} \nl 
    \par{a^{m}}^n &= a^{mn} \cma \label{eq:exp-law-mn} \nl 
    \par{ab}^n &= a^n \, b^n \pd \label{eq:exp-law-a-b}
    \end{align}
    We won't prove these properties, 
    but you can perform some testing to verify that they are true.
    (We will study these properties more in depth in Section
    <a href="/Valculus/calculus/0.7-Exponents-and-Logarithms.html">0.7</a>.)
</p>

<p>
    A <span class="emph">polynomial</span> 
    is a sum or difference of variables with nonnegative integer (whole number) powers.
    A polynomial is classified by its <i>highest-power</i> term;
    For example, \(x^3 + 5x^2 - 8\) is a <i>third-degree</i> polynomial
    and \(x^6 + x - 2\) is a <i>sixth-degree</i> polynomial.
    A <i>second-degree</i> polynomial is called <span class="emph">quadratic</span>; 
    we investigate quadratic expressions and functions more in Section 
    <a href="/Valculus/calculus/0.5-Quadratics.html">0.5</a>.
    Polynomials are prevalent in calculus; 
    we devote the remainder of this section to operations with polynomials.

<h4 id="factoring-polynomials">Factoring Polynomials</h4>
<p>
    <span class="emph">Factoring</span> is the process of decomposing 
    a number or expression into the product of two or more terms (<i>factors</i>).
    For example, the number \(10\) is factored as \(2 \times 5.\)
    There are several techniques to factor polynomials.
    The most important one is by extracting the <span class="emph">greatest common factor</span>
    (<span class="emph">GCF</span>), 
    the largest factor common to all terms in the expression.
    This process is the <i>first step</i> of factoring a polynomial.

    Next we examine the strategy for factoring the family of quadratics
    \(x^2 + bx + c\) into two <i>binomials</i>.
    (A binomial is the sum or difference of two terms.)
    The objective is to find two numbers \(p\) and \(q\) whose product is \(c\)
    and sum is \(b;\)
    then 
    \[x^2 + bx + c = (x + p)(x + q) \pd\] 
    The following example demonstrates this procedure.

    </aside>
    We identify \(b = -1\) and \(c = -20.\)
    What two numbers multiply to \(-20\) and add to \(-1 \ques\)
    By trial and error, the two numbers are \(p = -5\) and \(q = 4.\)

<div id="solution10" class="solution">
    To clear the right side, we subtract \(12x\) and add \(16\) to both sides;

    \[2x^2 - 12x + 16 = 0 \pd\]
    The GCF of the left side is \(2,\)
    which we extract to get
    \[2(x^2 - 6x + 8) = 0 \pd\]
    Observe that \(p = -4\) and \(q = -2\) have a product of \(8\) and a sum of \(-6.\)
    Hence, factoring the expression in parentheses gives 
    \[2(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0 \pd\]
    By the Zero Property of Multiplication, 
    the left side equals \(0\)
    if <i>at least one factor equals \(0.\)</i>
    Equating each factor to \(0,\) we see
    \[
    \baat{2}

<p>
    Let's now discuss <span class="emph">factoring by grouping</span>. 
    Using this technique, we split a polynomial into pairs of terms, 
    each of which we factor independently. 
    Factoring by grouping works if each pair shares a common factor;
    then the polynomial's factored form contains the shared factor
    multiplied by the sum of the groups' GCFs, 
    as shown by the following examples.
</p>

<div class="example-title"> EXAMPLE 11 </div>
<div class="example">
    <div class="example-problem">  
        Factor \(x^3 + 5x^2 + 2x + 10.\)

</div>
<button onclick="toggle11()" class="solution-button">  </button>
<div id="solution11" class="solution">
    We skip the preliminary step of extracting a GCF because none exists.
    To factor by grouping, we split the expression into two pairs and factor each independently by extracting GCFs:
    \[
    \underbrace{x^3 + 5x^2}_{\orange{x^2} (x + 5)} + \underbrace{2x + 10}_{\orange{2}(x + 5)} \pd
    \]
    Each pair shares the common factor \((x + 5),\)
    and the sum of the GCFs is \((\orange{x^2} + \orange{2}).\)
    So the factored form is
    \[\boxed{(x + 5)(\orange{x^2} + \orange{2})}\]
    Note that \((\orange{x^2} + \orange{2})\) is prime;
    it can't be factored any further.
</div>

<p>
    Factoring by grouping is useful for factoring quadratics 
    in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c\) \((a \ne 0)\)
    when no GCF is present. 
    The objective is to find two numbers \(p\) and \(q\) 
    whose product is \(c\) and sum is \(b,\)
    and then split \(bx\) into \(px + qx.\)
    The resulting expression can be factored by grouping,
    as shown by the next example.
</p>

    we have \(ac = 6.\) 
    The numbers \(p = 2\) and \(q = 3\) multiply to \(6\) and add to \(5.\)
    We therefore split \(5x\) into \(2x + 3x\)
    and factor by grouping:
    \[\underbrace{6x^2 + 2x}_{\orange{2x} (3x + 1)} + \underbrace{3x + 1}_{\orange{1} (3x + 1)} \pd\]
    The shared factor is \((3x + 1),\) and the sum of the GCFs is \((\orange{2x} + \orange{1}).\)
    Hence, the factored form is
    \[\boxed{(3x + 1)(\orange{2x} + \orange{1})}\]

<h4 id="operations-with-fractions">Operations with Fractions</h4>
<p>
    Fractions represent the division of two quantities.
    Recall that the top part of a fraction is the numerator
    and the bottom part is the denominator. 
    Multiplying fractions is easy—we simply multiply across;
    for example,
    \[\tfrac{2}{3} \times \tfrac{5}{6} = \tfrac{10}{18} = \tfrac{5}{9} \pd\]
    (In the last step we divided the numerator and denominator 
    each by \(2.\) Multiplying or dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number 
    <span class="good">does not alter the fraction's value</span>.)
    In dividing two fractions, we <i>flip</i> the second fraction
    and perform multiplication. 
    As an example,
    to divide \(\tfrac{4}{5}\) by \(\tfrac{8}{7},\)
    we have 
    \[\tfrac{4}{5} \times \tfrac{7}{8} = \tfrac{28}{40} = \tfrac{7}{10} \pd\]
    The fractions \(\tfrac{8}{7}\) and \(\tfrac{7}{8}\)
    are <i>reciprocals</i> of each other. 
    The same logic with numerical fractions applies to fractions with algebraic expressions, 
    as in the next examples.

    But if no common denominator is present, 
    then we multiply both parts of one fraction (or both fractions) to force the existence of one.
    For example,

    To simplify a quotient of polynomials that may share no common factors,

<div class="steps-title">HOW TO PERFORM POLYNOMIAL DIVISION</div>
<div class="steps">
    To divide a quotient \(P/Q,\)

    use the following steps:
    <ol class="list-num">
        <li>
            Write out the terms of \(P\) in order of descending powers.

            Divide the first term of \(P\) by the first term of \(Q;\)
            place that answer above the horizontal line.

        <li>
            Divide the first term of the new polynomial by the first term of \(Q.\)

                \begin{alignat}{2}
                a^2 - b^2 &= (a + b)(a - b) \comment{\text{Difference of Squares}} \eqlabel{eq:diff-sq} \nl
                a^3 + b^3 &= (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) \comment{\text{Sum of Cubes}} \eqlabel{eq:sum-cb} \nl
                a^3 - b^3 &= (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) \comment{\text{Difference of Cubes}} \eqlabel{eq:diff-cb}
                \end{alignat}

                A polynomial can be split into pairs of terms, 
                each of which is factored independently. 
                If each pair shares a common factor, then the resulting polynomial 
                is the product of two sets of parentheses: one containing the shared factor, 
                and the other containing the sum of the groups' GCFs.

        To factor \(ax^2 + bx + c\) \((a \ne 0),\)  
        we find two numbers \(p\) and \(q\) whose product is \(c\) and sum is \(b.\)
        Then we split \(bx\) into \(px + qx\)
        and factor the resulting polynomial by grouping.

        The procedures for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing numerical fractions
        are identical to those for fractions containing algebraic expressions. 
        Multiplying fractions is the simplest operation—simply multiply the numerators together 
        and multiply the denominators together. 
        Dividing two fractions is equivalent to multiplying the first fraction by the <i>reciprocal</i> of the second fraction.
        To add or subtract two fractions, <i>attain a common denominator</i>; 
        if one does not exist, then multiply the numerator and denominator of one fraction (or both fractions) 
        to force the existence of a common denominator.
        <span class="emph">Polynomial division</span> enables us to decompose a quotient of two polynomials;
        it is analogous to long division for numbers. 
        The steps for dividing \(P/Q,\)
        where \(P\) and \(Q\) are polynomials such that the degree of \(Q\) 
        is less than the degree of \(P,\)
        are as follows:
        <ol class="list-num">
            <li>
                Write out the terms of \(P\) in order of descending powers.
                To the left of the expression, draw a right parenthesis <q>\()\)</q>;
                above the expression, draw a horizontal line.
                To the left of the parenthesis, 
                write out the terms of \(Q\) in order of descending powers. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the first term of \(P\) by the first term of \(Q;\)
                place that answer above the horizontal line.
                Multiply \(Q\) by that answer and write the result in a new row at the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>
                Subtract the result of Step 2 from \(P\) to generate a new polynomial.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the first term of the new polynomial by the first term of \(Q.\)
                Multiply \(Q\) by that result and subtract it from the new polynomial.
                Repeat this process until the resulting polynomial has a degree smaller than the degree of \(Q.\)
