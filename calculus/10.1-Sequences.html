    In many everyday applications, we write numbers in a definite order;
    for example, we can record the number of natural disasters that occurred every year after 2000.
    Patterns of numbers are also central to many mathematical contexts;
    using calculus, we can extend patterns to infinity and analyze their properties.
    We discuss the following topics:

<h4 id="defining-a-sequence">Defining a Sequence</h4>
<p>
    A <span class="emph">sequence</span> is a list of numbers written in a definite order:  
    \[\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_N\} \pd\]
    We call \(a_1\) the <i>first term</i>, \(a_2\) the <i>second term</i>, 
    and \(a_N\) the <i><nobr>\(N\)th</nobr> term</i>. 
    A condensed notation for the sequence is \(\{a_n\}\subsuper{1}{N}.\)
    In calculus, we work with <span class="emph">infinite sequences</span>, which take the form 
    \(\{a_n\}\subsuper{1}{\infty}.\)
    But \(n\) doesn't have to begin at \(1;\)
    this is only a generalized case.
    Given that each \(n\) maps onto another number \(a_n,\) 
    we can think of a sequence as a function whose domain is nonnegative integers.

<h4 id="limits-of-sequences">Limits of Sequences</h4>

<p>
    In calculus we study functions of a real variable,
    whereas sequences are defined by the discrete integer \(n.\)
    But it turns out that sequences have a deep connection to functions 
    of a real variable.
    As we increase \(n,\) the terms of the sequence \(\{a_n\}\)
    could approach some number \(L,\)
    but they could also fail to settle to any final value. 
    We communicate this idea by taking the limit of \(a_n\) as \(n \to \infty.\)
    But how do we find the limit of an expression that's defined by nonnegative integers? 
    Let \(f\) be a function of a real variable such that \(f(n) = a_n\) for every nonnegative integer \(n.\)
    If \(\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L,\) then it turns out that
    \[\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L \pd\]
    Simply put, we find the limit of a sequence 
    similarly to how we find the limit of a function.
    A sequence \(\{a_n\}\) <span class="emph">converges</span>
    to \(L\) if \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L.\)
    Then we can make the terms of \(\{a_n\}\) as close to \(L\)
    as we please by making \(n\) sufficiently large 
    (<a href="#sequence-converge">Figure 1A</a>).
    Conversely, if \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n\) does not exist,
    then \(\{a_n\}\) <span class="emph">diverges</span>—meaning 
    the terms of \(\{a_n\}\) do not approach any final value as \(n \to \infty\)
    (<a href="#sequence-diverge">Figure 1B</a>).

    For example, the sequence defined by \(a_n = 1/n\)
    converges to \(0\) because 
    \[\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0 \pd\]
    For \(n \geq 1,\) the terms of \(\{a_n\}\) are 
    \[\left\{1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \dots \right\} \cma\]
    and we observe that each term gets closer \(0\) as \(n \to \infty.\)
</p>
<p>
    Formally, a sequence \(\{a_n\}\) converges to \(L\) 
    if and only if, for every \(\varepsilon \gt 0,\) a nonnegative integer \(N\) exists such that 
    \[\abs{a_n - L} \lt \varepsilon \for n \gt N \pd\]
    This statement asserts that for \(n \gt N,\) 
    \(a_n\) must not differ from \(L\) 
    by more than \(\varepsilon.\) 
    The value of \(\varepsilon\) can be made smaller as \(N\) is increased.
    <a href="#sequences-epsilon">Figure 2</a> depicts a graphical relationship:
    the distance between \(L\) and \(a_n\) is \(\abs{a_n - L},\)
    which is bounded by \(\varepsilon\) and shrinks as \(n \to \infty.\)

<div id="solution3" class="solution">
    The sequence \(\{n/e^n\}\) converges
    if and only if \(\lim_{n \to \infty} (n/e^n)\) exists.
    This limit is equivalent to 
    the limit of the real-valued function \(x/e^x\) as \(x \to \infty,\) namely, 
    \[\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x}{e^x} \pd\]
    Both the numerator and denominator approach \(\infty,\)
    so this limit is in the indeterminate form \(\indInfty.\)
    By L'Hôpital's Rule
    (see Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/3.4-Indeterminate-Forms-and-L'Hopital's-Rule.html">3.4</a>),
    we differentiate the numerator and denominator and retake the limit;
    doing so asserts that
    \[\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{e^x} = 0 \pd\]
    It therefore follows that
    \[\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{e^n} = 0 \pd\]

    As we discussed in Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/1.6-Limits-with-Infinity.html">1.6</a>,
    we can evaluate this limit by considering only the highest-degree terms

    &= \lim_{n \to \infty} n = \infty \pd
    \ea

    (This method is a shortcut to dividing every term by the 
    highest-degree term in the denominator, \(\sqrt{n^4}\) <nobr>\(= \abs{n^2}.\))</nobr>

    <span class="label-emph">Fibonacci Sequence</span>
    In the 13th century, the Italian mathematician Fibonacci
    developed a sequence to model an ideal breeding pattern in rabbits:
    Suppose that two rabbits are left in a field; 
    each rabbit pair mates 
    at the end of the first month 
    and gives birth to another rabbit pair at the end of the second month.
    Assume that all the rabbits are reproductive and never die.
    At the end of the first month, the first pair mates
    but remains in gestation,
    so the number of rabbit pairs remains at \(1.\)
    But at the end of the second month, the first pair finally gives birth to 
    another pair of rabbits—giving us \(2\) rabbit pairs.
    Likewise, at the end of the third month, the original pair produces another 
    pair, but the second pair remains in its gestation period;
    we therefore have \(3\) rabbit pairs. 
    And at the end of the fourth month, the first and second rabbit pair have each 
    given birth to a new rabbit pair, but the third rabbit pair has not yet finished gestation—leaving 
    us with \(5\) rabbit pairs. 
    So the number of rabbit pairs after \(n\) months is, starting from \(n = 0,\) 
    modeled by the sequence
    \[\{1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \dots\} \pd\]
    Remarkably, each term is the sum of the previous two terms.
    This surprising pattern is called the <span class="emph">Fibonacci Sequence</span>,
    which we can write recursively as
    \begin{equation}
    f_1 = 1 \cmaa f_2 = 1 \cmaa f_n = f_{n - 1} + f_{n - 2} \cmaa n \geq 3 \pd \label{eq:fib-sequence}
    \end{equation}
    The Fibonacci sequence is divergent because \(f_n \to \infty\) as \(n \to \infty.\)
    This result is expected;
    the number of rabbit pairs should increase indefinitely
    as increasingly many rabbits reproduce.

<div class="box-title">FIBONACCI SEQUENCE</div>
<div class="box">
    The <span class="emph">Fibonacci Sequence</span> is

    increasing or decreasing, and monotonicity.

<aside class="box-tip">
    Every increasing or decreasing sequence is monotonic.

        We can solve this problem using two methods—one by 
        manipulating inequalities and the other by comparing the sequence to a function.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="label-emph">Method 1</span>
        The sequence is increasing if and only if, for all nonnegative \(n,\)
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{3(n + 1)}{1 + 4(n + 1)} \gt \frac{3n}{1 + 4n} \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        Manipulating the inequality, we see 
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{3n + 3}{4n + 5} &\gt \frac{3n}{1 + 4n} \nl
        (3n + 3)(1 + 4n) &\gt 3n (4n + 5) \nl 
        12n^2 + 15n + 3 &\gt 12n^2 + 15n \nl 
        3 &\gt 0 \pd
        \ea     
        \]
        So this inequality is satisfied for all \(n.\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="label-emph">Method 2</span>
        Let's compare the sequence to the function \(f(x) = 3x/(1 + 4x).\)
        The sequence and the function \(f\) increase together; 
        we therefore show \(f'(x) \gt 0.\)
        Differentiating gives 
        \[f'(x) = \frac{3(1 + 4x) - 3x (4)}{(1 + 4x)^2} = \frac{3}{(1 + 4x)^2} \cma\]
        which is positive for all \(x.\)
        Hence, the sequence is also increasing for all nonnegative \(n.\)

    As shown by <a href="/Valculus/calculus/10.1-Sequences.html#ex-sequence-0-1">Example 7</a>,
    the terms of \(n/(n + 1)\) 
    continually grow toward \(1,\) a number that bounds the sequence,
    so \(\{n/(n + 1)\}\) converges.
    Yet in <a href="/Valculus/calculus/10.1-Sequences.html#ex-sequence-alt">Example 4</a>
    the divergent sequence \(\{(-1)^n\}\) is bounded (between \(-1\) and <nobr>\(1\))</nobr>
    but is not monotonic.
    Thus, not all bounded sequences are convergent.
    But it seems that <i>any sequence that is bounded and monotonic is convergent</i>;
    intuitively, a convergent sequence's terms should edge toward a bounding value.
    This conclusion happens to be true,
    as stated by the <span class="emph">Monotonic Sequence Theorem</span>.

    <span class="proof">PROOF</span>
    Let's first prove the Monotonic Sequence Theorem 
    for a nondecreasing sequence \(\{a_n\}.\)
    Since the sequence is bounded, an upper bound \(M\) exists such that
    \[a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq \dots \leq a_n \leq M \pd\]
    By the Completeness Axiom, any nonempty set of real numbers 
    that is bounded above has a <i>least upper bound</i> \(L.\)
    So we see 
    \[a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq \dots \leq a_n \leq L \pd\]
    For \(\varepsilon \gt 0,\) we have \(L - \varepsilon \lt L.\)
    But since \(L\) is the least upper bound to \(\{a_n\},\)
    the expression \(L - \varepsilon\) is <i>not</i> an upper bound to the sequence. 
    Mathematically, \(a_N \gt L - \varepsilon\) for any nonnegative integer \(N.\) 
    Because the terms are nondecreasing, we have \(a_N \leq a_n\) for \(n \gt N.\)
    We therefore conclude, for all \(n \gt N,\)
    \[
    L - \varepsilon \lt a_N \leq a_n \leq L \lt L + \varepsilon \pd 
    \]
    So we see
    \[L - \varepsilon \lt a_n \lt L + \varepsilon
    \iffArrow \abs{a_n - L} \lt \varepsilon \pd
    \]
    By the definition of a convergent sequence, \(\{a_n\}\) converges.
    The proof for a nonincreasing sequence is similar.

        It is a good idea to write out a few terms to observe the sequence's behavior, as follows:
        \[
        \baat{2}
        a_2 &= \tfrac{1}{2} a_1 + 4 = 5 &\lspace a_3 &= \tfrac{1}{2} a_2 + 4 = 6.5 \nl

        a_8 &= 7.953125 &\lspace a_9 &= 7.9765625 \pd
        \eaat
        \]
        It appears that the sequence is increasing and bounded above by \(8.\)
        Now let's verify this guess.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="label-emph">Monotonicity and Boundedness</span>
        Let's prove mathematically that the sequence is increasing.
        We use a Proof by Induction to prove that \(a_{n + 1} \gt a_n\)
        for all \(n \geq 1.\)
        First observe that \(a_2 \gt a_1,\)
        so the inequality is true for \(n = 1.\)
        Assuming that \(a_{n + 1} \gt a_n\) is true for \(n = k,\) where \(k \gt 1,\) we have
        \[
        \ba
        a_{k + 1} &\gt a_k \nl 
        \tfrac{1}{2} a_{k + 1} &\gt \tfrac{1}{2} a_k \nl 
        \tfrac{1}{2} a_{k + 1} + 4 &\gt \tfrac{1}{2} a_k + 4 \nl
        a_{k + 2} &\gt a_{k + 1} \pd
        \ea
        \]
        Hence, \(a_{n + 1} \gt a_n\) is true for \(n = k + 1.\)
        Thus, by mathematical induction, the sequence \(a_n\) is increasing for all \(n \geq 1.\)
        Let's now show that the sequence is bounded:
        Since the sequence is increasing for \(n \geq 1,\) it has a lower bound of \(m = a_1 = 2.\)
        We know \(a_1 \lt 8,\) so let's prove that \(a_n \lt 8\) for all \(n.\)
        Assuming that \(a_n \lt 8\) is true for \(n = k\) (where <nobr> \(k \gt 1\)),</nobr> we see 
        \[
        \ba
        a_k &\lt 8 \nl 
        \tfrac{1}{2} a_k &\lt \tfrac{1}{2} (8) = 4 \nl 
        \tfrac{1}{2} a_k + 4 &\lt 4 + 4 = 8 \nl
        a_{k + 1} &\lt 8 \pd 
        \ea
        \]
        By mathematical induction, \(a_n \lt 8\) for all \(n \geq 1.\)
        So \(2 \leq a_n \lt 8\) for all \(n \geq 1,\)
        meaning the sequence is bounded. 
        Since the sequence is increasing, it is monotonic. 
        Because \(\{a_n\}\) is bounded and monotonic, it <b>converges</b> by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="label-emph">Limit of the Sequence</span>
        Given that the sequence converges, both \(a_{n + 1}\) and \(a_n\) 
        approach the same value \(L\) as \(n \to \infty.\)
        Our analysis has proved that \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n\) exists,
        but we don't know what it equals. 
        Using the recursive relationship, we see 
        \[
        \ba
        \lim_{n \to \infty} a_{n + 1} &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \par{\tfrac{1}{2} a_n + 4} \nl 
        L &= \tfrac{1}{2} L + 4 \nl 
        L &= 8 \pd
        \ea
        \]
        So the limit of the sequence is \(\boxed{8},\) as we expect.

        A <span class="emph">sequence</span> is a set of numbers written in a definite order:
        \[\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_N\} \pd\]
        We call \(a_1\) the <i>first term</i>, \(a_2\) the <i>second term</i>, 
        and \(a_N\) the <i><nobr>\(N\)th</nobr> term</i>. 
        A condensed notation for the sequence is \(\{a_n\}\subsuper{1}{N}.\)
        Sequences have many applications in ordering values in a particular order. 
        In calculus, we work with <span class="emph">infinite sequences</span>, which take the form 
        \(\{a_n\}\subsuper{1}{\infty}.\)
        The generalized case has a starting index of \(n = 1,\)
        but we can adjust this index to be any nonnegative integer.
        Each \(n\) corresponds to another number \(a_n,\) 
        so a sequence is a function whose domain is nonnegative integers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#limits-of-sequences" class="summary-anchor">Limits of Sequences</a>
        As \(n \to \infty,\) the terms of \(a_n\) may tend to some fixed value \(L\)—that is, 
        \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L.\)
        If so, then the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is said to <span class="emph">converge</span> and have 
        a limit of \(L.\) 
        Otherwise, the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is said to <span class="emph">diverge</span>.
        A famous example of a divergent sequence is the <span class="emph">Fibonacci Sequence</span>, 
        in which each term is the sum of the two preceding terms,
        as defined recursively by 
        \begin{equation}
        f_1 = 1 \cmaa f_2 = 1 \cmaa f_n = f_{n - 1} + f_{n - 2} \cmaa n \geq 3 \pd \eqlabel{eq:fib-sequence}
        \end{equation}
        When expanded, the sequence is
        \[\{1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \dots\} \pd\]
        Formally, a sequence \(\{a_n\}\) converges to \(L\) 
        if and only if, for every \(\varepsilon \gt 0,\) a nonnegative integer \(N\) exists such that 
        \[\abs{a_n - L} \lt \varepsilon \for n \gt N \pd\]
        We compute the limit of a sequence similarly to how we compute the limit of a function 
        of a real variable:
        If \(f(x)\) is a function (of a real variable <nobr>\(x\))</nobr> 
        such that \(f(n) = a_n\) for all nonnegative integers \(n,\)
        then 
        \[\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) \pd\]
        We take the limits of combinations of sequences by using Limit Laws.
        If \(\{a_n\}\) and \(\{b_n\}\) are convergent sequences 
        and \(c\) is a constant, then 
        the following properties are true:
        \[
        \ba 
        &\lim_{n \to \infty} \par{a_n + b_n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n + \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n \cma \nl 
        &\lim_{n \to \infty} \par{a_n - b_n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n - \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n \cma \nl
        &\lim_{n \to \infty} \par{a_n b_n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \cdot \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n \cma \nl 
        &\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} 
        = \frac{\ds \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n}{\ds \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n} \cmaa \lim_{n \to \infty} b_n \ne 0 \cma \nl 
        &\lim_{n \to \infty} \par{c a_n} = c \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        The Squeeze Theorem can be applied to sequences as follows:
        if \(b_n \leq a_n \leq c_n\) for \(n \geq N\) (where \(N\) is any nonnegative integer)
        and 
        \[\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} c_n = L \cma\]
        then \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L.\)
