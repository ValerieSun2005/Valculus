    The electric field experienced by a charged object \(r\) meters away due to the wire is 
    \[E = \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi \varepsilon_0 r} \cma\]
    where \(\varepsilon_0\) is a physical constant called the <i>permittivity of free space</i>.
    The wire's charge density is decreasing at a rate of \(3\) coulombs per meter per second,
    and the object's distance from the wire is increasing at a rate of \(2\) meters per second.
    At a certain instant, the wire's charge density is \(1\) coulomb per meter  
    and the object is \(9\) meters away from the wire. 
    How fast is the electric field changing at this moment?

    In baseball the playing field consists of a <i>home plate</i> and three bases—bases \(1,\) \(2,\) and \(3.\)
    These points are the vertices of a diamond whose sides are \(90\) feet long. 
    (<a href="#related-rates-baseball-field">Figure 2</a> shows a simplified diagram of the playing field.)
    A baseball player begins to run from second base to third base at a speed of \(20\) feet per second.
    After three seconds of running, find the rate at which the distance between the player and home plate is changing.

    A batter hits a baseball from home plate straight to second base at a speed of \(122\) feet per second.
    After \(0.5\) second, how quickly is the distance between the baseball and first base changing?
