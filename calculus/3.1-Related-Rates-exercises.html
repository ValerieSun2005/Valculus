    The radius of the cylinder steadily increases at a rate of \(4\) inches per second.
    When the cylinder's radius is \(6\) inches,
    find the rate at which the cylinder's thickness is changing.

    A uniform, conducting wire has a linear charge density \(\lambda.\)
    The electric field, in newtons per coulomb, acting on a charged object
    located \(r\) meters away from the wire is
    \[E = \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi \varepsilon_0 r} \cma\]
    where \(\varepsilon_0\) is a physical constant called the <b>permittivity of free space</b>.
    The wire's charge density is decreasing at a rate of \(3\) coulombs per meter per second,
    and the object's distance from the wire is increasing at a rate of \(2\) meters per second.
    At a certain instant, the wire's charge density is \(1\) coulomb per meter

    How fast is the electric field changing at this moment?

    In baseball the playing field consists of a <b>home plate</b> and three bases—bases \(1,\) \(2,\) and \(3.\)
    These points are the vertices of a diamond whose sides are \(90\) feet long. 
    (<a href="#related-rates-baseball-field">Figure 9</a> shows a simplified diagram of the playing field.)
    A baseball player begins to run from second base to third base at a speed of \(20\) feet per second.
    After \(3\) seconds of running, find the rate at which the distance between the player and home plate is changing.
