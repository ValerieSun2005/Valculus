<h4 id="exponential-growth">Exponential Growth</h4>
<p>
    <span class="emph">Exponential growth</span> is a phenomenon in which a quantity undergoes very fast growth.
    Specifically, if \(y\) grows exponentially,  
    then \(y\) increases at a rate proportional to itself. 
    Mathematically, \(y\) satisfies the differential equation  
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{x} = k y \comma  \label{eq:exp-growth-diff-eq}
    \end{equation}
    <figure class="exponential-growth-y0" id="exponential-growth-y0">
        <img src="../images/sectionImages/exponential-growth-y0.jpg" alt="Figure 2">

    <style>
        .exponential-growth-y0::before{
            content:'FIGURE 2';
        }
    </style>
    where \(k\) is the <span class="emph">growth constant</span>. 
    For clarity, we assume \(k \gt 0.\)
    \(\eqRefer{eq:exp-growth-diff-eq}\) asserts small values of \(y\) grow slowly and large values grow quickly. 
    Solving for \(y\) in \(\eqref{eq:exp-growth-diff-eq}\) using Separation of Variables, 
    we get
    \[
    \ba 
    \frac{1}{y} \di y &= k \di x \nl 
    \int \frac{1}{y} \di y &= \int k \di x \nl 
    \ln \abs{y} &= kx + C \nl 
    y &= e^{C} e^{kx} \pd   
    \ea 
    \]
    If \(y_0\) is the value of \(y\) when \(x = 0,\) then substituting this initial condition shows  
    \[y_0 = e^{C} e^{k(0)} = e^C \pd\]
    Hence, \(e^C\) is \(y_0\) and so the solution to \(\eqref{eq:exp-growth-diff-eq}\) is
    \begin{equation} 
    y = y_0 e^{kx} \pd \label{eq:exp-growth}
    \end{equation}
    In <a href="#exponential-growth">Figure 1</a>, 
    the graph of \(y = y_0e^{kx}\) is plotted. 
    Since its shape resembles the letter <i>J</i>,
    the curve is often called a <i>J-curve</i>.
    We obtain different graphs by changing the value of \(y_0;\)
    <a href="#exponential-growth-y0">Figure 2</a> 
    shows graphs of the family of graphs \(y = y_0e^{kx}\) for selected values of \(y_0.\)

        Since the growth of \(f(x)\) is proportional to itself, 
        \(f\) satisfies the differential equation 
        \[f'(x) = k f(x) \cma\]
        where \(k\) is the growth constant. 
        This equation matches \(\eqref{eq:exp-growth-diff-eq},\)
        the definition of <i>exponential growth</i>. 
        Hence, for unknown \(y_0\) and \(k\) the form of \(f\) is 
        \begin{equation} 
        f(x) = y_0e^{kx} \pd \label{eq:exp-growth-f}
        \end{equation}
        Our goal is to solve for \(y_0\) and \(k\) that satisfy the initial conditions 
        \(f(3) = 120\) and \(f(6) = 360.\)
    </p>
    <p>
        In \(\eqref{eq:exp-growth-f}\) we substitute the initial conditions to solve for \(y_0\) and \(k;\)
        that is, we have 
        \begin{equation} 
        120 = y_0e^{3k} \and 360 = y_0e^{6k} \pd \label{eq:exp-growth-f-eqs}
        \end{equation}
        It is easy to first solve for \(k\) by dividing the equations in \(\eqref{eq:exp-growth-f-eqs},\) 
        as doing so cancels out the unknown factor \(y_0.\)
        Dividing the latter equation by the former equation shows  
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{360}{120} &= \frac{\cancel{y_0} e^{6k}}{\cancel{y_0} e^{3k}} \nl 
        3 &= e^{6k - 3k} = e^{3k} \nl 
        k &= \frac{\ln 3}{3} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        To find \(y_0\) we substitute \(k = (\ln 3)/3\) into either equation in \(\eqref{eq:exp-growth-f-eqs};\) 
        for example, the former equation becomes  
        \[
        \ba 
        120 &= y_0e^{3(\ln 3)/3} \nl 
        120 &= 3 y_0 \nl 
        40 &= y_0 \pd  
        \ea 
        \]
        We therefore have the missing values of \(y_0\) and \(k\) in \(\eqref{eq:exp-growth-f},\)
        so 
        \[f(x) = 40e^{[(\ln 3)/3]x} = \boxed{40(3)^{x/3}}\]

<p>
    Suppose \(y\) grows exponentially with time \(t.\)
    The rate at which \(y\) grows is changing.
    But \(y\) takes the same time to multiply by the same factor; for example,
    \(y\) takes the same time to grow from \(100\) to \(200\)
    as it does to grow from \(1000\) to \(2000.\)
    Let \(\doublingTime\) be the time that \(y\) takes to double to \(2y.\)
    We call \(\doublingTime\) the <span class="emph">doubling time</span>.
    <a href="#doubling-time">Figure 3</a> shows the graph of \(y = y_0e^{kt},\)
    where \(y_0\) doubles to \(2 y_0\) after the doubling time \(\doublingTime\)
    has elapsed.
    We solve for \(\doublingTime\) by first establishing that 
    \(y_0e^{k\doublingTime} = 2y_0.\)
    Then we find 
    \begin{align} 
    e^{k\doublingTime} &= 2 \nonumber \nl 
    k\doublingTime &= \ln 2 \nonumber \nl  
    \doublingTime &= \frac{\ln 2}{k} \pd \label{eq:doubling-time}
    \end{align}
    In words, \(\eqrefer{eq:doubling-time}\) states 
    that the doubling time for an exponential growth model 
    is \(\ln 2\) divided by the growth constant. 
    If \(k\) is expressed as a percentage,
    then \(\eqref{eq:doubling-time}\) is often called the <i>rule of \(\mathcal{70}\)</i>
    because \(\ln 2 \approx 0.7.\)
    We must remember that \(\eqref{eq:doubling-time}\) only applies 
    if the base of the exponential model is \(e;\) otherwise, 
    we must convert the base.

<h4 id="compound-interest">Compound Interest</h4>
<p>
    When money is lent, it earns <i>interest</i>. 
    <span class="emph">Simple interest</span> is paid once over a time period (for example, \(1\) year).
    If a principal amount of \(P\) dollars earns simple interest per year at an 
    <span class="emph">interest rate</span> of \(r,\) 
    then after one year the amount becomes \(A = P(1 + r).\)
    Likewise, after two years we have \(A = P(1 + r)^2,\)
    and after \(t\) years the balance is \(A = P(1 + r)^t.\)
</p>
<p>
    <span class="emph">Compound interest</span> is paid multiple times over a time period.
    Suppose a principal amount of 
    \(P\) dollars grows at an interest rate of \(r,\) compounded biannually 
    (twice per year). 
    Then after one year the amount becomes \(A =\) \(P(1 + r/2)^2,\)
    and after \(t\) years we have \(A = P(1 + r/2)^{2t}.\) 
    If the interest rate is compounded three times annually at the same rate \(r,\) 
    then the amount after \(t\) years is \(A = P(1 + r/3)^{3t}.\)
    This pattern continues:
    \[
    \baat{2} 
    A &= P \par{1 + \frac{r}{4}}^{4t} \lspace &&\text{compounded 4 times annually} \nl 
    A &= P \par{1 + \frac{r}{5}}^{5t} \lspace &&\text{compounded 5 times annually} \nl 
    A &= P \par{1 + \frac{r}{6}}^{6t} \lspace &&\text{compounded 6 times annually} \nl
    & \vdots && \vdots \nl 
    \eaat
    \]
    The general pattern is, for \(r\) compounded \(n\) times annually for \(t\) time periods, 
    \begin{equation} 
    A = P \par{1 + \frac{r}{n}}^{nt} \pd \label{eq:compound-interest}
    \end{equation}
    But if \(r\) is <i>continuously</i> compoundedâ€”that is, as \(n \to \infty\)â€”then 
    \(\eqref{eq:compound-interest}\) becomes 
    \begin{equation} 
    A = \lim_{n \to \infty} P \par{1 + \frac{r}{n}}^{nt} \pd \label{eq:compound-interest-lim}
    \end{equation}
    We must notice that this form resembles the limit definition of a special number: \(e = \lim_{m \to \infty} (1 + 1/m)^m.\) 
    Hence, we manipulate \(\eqref{eq:compound-interest-lim}\) to match this form. 
    In \(\eqref{eq:compound-interest-lim}\) we want the quantity in parentheses to have the expression \((1 + 1/m).\)
    Let \(m = n/r.\) 
    We see that \(m \to \infty\) as \(n \to \infty;\) 
    \(\eqrefer{eq:compound-interest-lim}\) therefore becomes  
    \[
    \ba 
    A &= \lim_{m \to \infty} P \par{1 + \frac{1}{m}}^{rmt} \nl 
    &= P \parbr{\lim_{m \to \infty}\par{1 + \frac{1}{m}}^{m} \,}^{rt} \pd 
    \ea 
    \]
    The quantity in brackets is the limit definition of \(e,\) so we have 
    \begin{equation} 
    A = Pe^{rt} \pd \label{eq:compound-interest-cont}
    \end{equation}
    We use \(\eqref{eq:compound-interest}\) if the rate \(r\) is compounded a finite number of times in a time period.
    This growth is <i>discrete</i>. 
    In contrast, we use \(\eqref{eq:compound-interest-cont}\) for an <i>infinite</i> number of compounding events 
    in a time periodâ€”that is, if a quantity grows <i>continuously</i>.

    In exponential <i>growth</i>, the rate of increase of \(y\) is directly proportional to itself. 
    But in <span class="emph">exponential decay</span>,
    \(y\) <i>decreases</i> at a rate directly proportional to itself; that is,
    if \(y\) decays exponentially with \(x,\) then 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{x} = -ky \pd \label{eq:exp-decay-diff-eq}
    \end{equation}
    We call \(k\) the <span class="emph">decay constant</span>,
    and we assume \(k \gt 0,\) just as we do with the growth constant.
    Similar to steps of obtaining \(\eqref{eq:exp-growth},\)
    we perform Separation of Variables for \(\eqrefer{eq:exp-decay-diff-eq} \col\)
    \[

    \ln|y| &= -kx + C \nl 
    y &= e^{C} e^{-kx} \pd

    When a hot object rests in a cool environment,

    The temperature \(T\) decreases at a rate 
    proportional to the difference between \(T\) and the constant surrounding temperature \(T_s.\)
    If \(k\) is the decay constant and \(t\) is time, then the law gives the differential equation

    \([\textDeriv{y}{x} = -ky]\) by identifying \(x = t\) and \(y = T - T_s.\)
    Let \(T_0\) be the object's initial temperature, and we assume \(T_0 \gt T_s\)
    because the object is cooling.
    Then the solution to \(\eqref{eq:newtons-cooling-diff-eq}\) is, 
    by analogy to \(\eqref{eq:exp-decay}\) \([y = y_0 e^{-kx}],\)
    \begin{equation*}

    The constant \(k\) is a property of the cooling object.
    \(\eqrefer{eq:newtons-cooling}\) enables us to determine at any time the temperature of a cooling object 
    if its initial temperature \(T_0\) and the surrounding temperature \(T_s\) are known,
    and if we can measure the object's temperature after some time has elapsed.
</p>
<p>
    The graph of \(\eqrefer{eq:newtons-cooling}\) is illustrated in

    The object's temperature \(T\) begins at \(T_0\)
    before leveling off to \(T_s,\) the surrounding temperature.
    Note that \(T\) is always above \(T_s,\)
    which is logical because the cooling object shouldn't reach a temperature below the ambient temperature. 
    This model assumes that the object's heat dissipation does not warm up the surrounding environment. 
    If the object is smallâ€”for example, a cup of hot tea or a freshly baked cookieâ€”then this assumption is appropriate.

        Our objective is now to find the cooling constant \(k.\)
        We do so by substituting in \(\eqref{eq:cake-cooling-T}\) 
        the initial condition \(T(10) = 60 \col\)
        \[
        \ba 
        20 + 160e^{-10k} &= 60 \nl 
        160e^{-10k} &= 40 \nl 
        e^{-10k} &= \tfrac{40}{160} = \tfrac{1}{4} \nl 
        -10k &= \ln \tfrac{1}{4} \nl 
        k &= -\tfrac{1}{10} \ln \tfrac{1}{4} = \tfrac{1}{10} \ln 4 \pd   
        \ea 
        \]
        Consequently, \(\eqrefer{eq:cake-cooling-T}\) becomes 
        \[
        \ba 
        T(t) &= 20 + 160e^{-[(\ln 4)/10]t} \nl 
        &= 20 + 160(4)^{-t/10} \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        After \(20\) minutes, the cake's temperature is 
        \[T(30) = 20 + 160(4)^{-20/10} = \boxed{30 \celcius}\]

    A <span class="emph">resistanceâ€“capacitance (RC) circuit</span> consists of a capacitor and resistor.
    A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy on one of its conducting surfaces, 
    and capacitance \(C\) (unit, <b>farads</b>) is the ability of a capacitor to hold a charge \(Q\) (unit, <b>coulombs</b>).
    In <a href="#diff-eq-capacitor">Figure 8</a>,
    a charged capacitor is connected to a resistor of resistance \(R\) (unit, <b>ohms</b>).
    As current travels through the circuit, the capacitor is <i>discharging</i>
    and the resistance dissipates the energy in the circuit.
    Applying Kirchhoff's Loop Rule gives the differential equation 
    \[\frac{Q}{C} + R \deriv{Q}{t} = 0 \pd\]
    Solving for \(\textDeriv{Q}{t}\) and letting \(\tau = RC\) (\(\tau\) is the greek letter <i>tau</i>), we attain  
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{Q}{t} = -\frac{1}{\tau} Q \pd \label{eq:rc-diff-eq}
    \end{equation}
    We compare \(\eqref{eq:rc-diff-eq}\) \([\textDeriv{Q}{t} = -(1/\tau)Q]\) 
    to \(\eqref{eq:exp-decay-diff-eq}\) \([\textDeriv{y}{x} = -ky]\)
    by identifying \(k = 1/\tau.\)
    Through this comparison, we see that large values of \(\tau\)â€”called the 
    <span class="emph">time constant</span> of an RC circuitâ€”cause \(Q\)
    to decay slowly because the decay constant \(1/\tau\) is small.
    In contrast, small values of \(\tau\) enable \(Q\) to dissipate quickly
    due to the large decay constant.
    This interpretation is logical, since resistance \(R\) impedes the flow of current and capacitance \(C\)
    allows the capacitor to store charge; so large values of either quantity slow the capacitor's discharge.
    If \(Q_0\) is the initial charge on the capacitor, then the solution to \(\eqref{eq:rc-diff-eq}\) is 
    \begin{equation} 
    Q = Q_0 e^{-t/\tau} \pd \label{eq:rc-Q}
    \end{equation}
</p>
<figure class="time-constant-RC" id="time-constant-RC">
    <img src="../images/sectionImages/time-constant-RC.jpg" alt="Figure 9">

<style>
    .time-constant-RC::before{
        content:'FIGURE 9';
    }
</style>
<p>
    Similar to how half-lives are a standard to measure decay, 
    the level of charge \(Q\) on the capacitor can be gauged by how many time constants have elapsed.
    If \(\tau = 1,\) then \(\eqref{eq:rc-Q}\) becomes \(Q = Q_0 e^{-1} \approx 0.368 Q_0.\)
    Likewise, if \(\tau = 2\) then \(\eqref{eq:rc-Q}\) gives \(Q = Q_0 e^{-2} \approx 0.135Q_0.\)
    Thus, after one time constant has elapsed, approximately \(63.2 \%\) 
    of the capacitor's charge has been dissipated.
    After two time constants have passed, approximately \(86.5\%\)
    of the charge has been lost.
    This pattern is represented by the graph in <a href="#time-constant-RC">Figure 9</a>.
    Calculating the time constant helps an electrician ensure that a circuit is sufficiently discharged 
    and safe to operate on.
