    <span class="emph">Probability</span> measures the chance that an event occurs.
    Outcomes of dice rolling, card selection, and basketball shots are examples of <i>discrete</i> probabilities
    because they have finite outcomes.
    In calculus we work with <i>continuous</i> probabilities, in which a number can take on <i>any</i> value.
    A store might want to determine the probability that a customer waits in line for more than \(2\) minutes, 
    or a doctor might want to know the probability that her patient has a blood pressure above \(130 \un{mm Hg}.\)

    Let \(X\) denote a <i>continuous random variable</i>,
    meaning \(X\) is randomly assigned any number.
    The probability that the value of \(X\) lands between the numbers \(a\) and \(b\) is written as 
    \[P(a \leq X \leq b) \pd\]
    Every continuous random variable \(X\) has a <span class="emph">probability density function</span> \(f,\) 
    defined such that \(f(x) \geq 0\) and
    \begin{equation} 
    P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x) \di x \pd \label{eq:P-int}
    \end{equation}
    In words, to calculate the probability that \(X\) is between the numbers \(a\) and \(b,\)
    we find the area under the curve \(y = f(x)\) from \(x = a\) to \(x = b.\)
    (See <a href="#probability-graph-a-b">Figure 1</a>.)  
    Because probabilities are measured from \(0\) to \(1,\) it is a fact that
    \begin{equation} 
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \di x = 1 \pd \label{eq:prob-1}
    \end{equation}
    For a continuous random variable, we value probability density functions for the area under them;
    the particular values they output have little use to us.

<h4 id="exp-prob-density">Exponential Probability Density Functions</h4>
<p>
    Exponential decay functions are excellent probability density functions for phenomena 
    such as waiting times and equipment longevity.
    Consider the following examples:
    At the checkout counter, you'll likely be helped within a few minutes, 
    whereas long wait times are rarer.
    Likewise, among people who call into a support center, few customers are willing to wait for a long time.
    And a light bulb is unlikely to function for much longer than its expected lifespan.
    To derive a general probability density function \(f\) for such models, we let \(t\) be time 
    (in any unit) such that \(f(t) = 0\) for \(t \lt 0.\) 
    (You cannot be helped before you enter the line.)
    We have, for \(k \gt 0,\)
    \[
    f(t) = 
    \bc 
    0 & t \lt 0 \nl
    Ce^{-kt} & t \geq 0 \pd 
    \ec 
    \]
    Let's derive an expression for the area under the curve \(y = f(t).\)
    Clearly, the area under \(f\) over \(t\) in \((-\infty, 0)\) is \(0.\) 
    Thus, we evaluate the improper integral 
    (using the methods of Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/6.5-Improper-Integrals.html">6.5</a>) as follows:
    \[
    \ba 
    \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) \di t &= \int_0^\infty Ce^{-kt} \di t \nl 
    &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b Ce^{-kt} \di t \nl 
    &= \frac{C}{-k} \lim_{b \to \infty} \par{e^{-kt}} \intEval_0^b \nl 
    &= \frac{C}{-k} \par{0 - 1} \nl 
    &= \frac{C}{k} \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    By \(\eqref{eq:prob-1},\) \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) \di t\) must equal \(1.\)
    So \(C/k = 1,\) meaning \(C = k.\)
    Accordingly, all exponential decay functions are of the form
    \begin{equation} 
    f(t) = 
    \bc 
    0 & t \lt 0 \nl
    ke^{-kt} & t \geq 0 \pd 
    \ec 
    \label{eq:exp-density}
    \end{equation}  
    (See <a href="#probability-exp-decay">Figure 2</a>.)
    If \(C \ne k,\) then \(\eqref{eq:prob-1}\) is not satisfied and so \(f(t)\) 
    cannot be a probability density function.

            where \(t\) is the time (in minutes) that a customer waits.
            Our goal is to solve for \(k.\)
            Since \(80\%\) of customers are helped at the checkout counter within \(2\) minutes, 
            we have \(\int_0^2 f(t) \di t = 0.8.\)
            We see 
            \[
            \ba 
            \int_0^2 ke^{-kt} \di t &= 0.8 \nl 
            \frac{k}{-k} e^{-kt} \intEval_0^2 &= 0.8 \nl
            e^0 - e^{-2k} &= 0.8 \nl

            \ea

            Hence, the exponential probability density function is 
            \[
            f(t) = 
            \boxed{

            We see 
            \[
            P(T \gt 5) = \int_5^\infty f(t) \di t \pd

            Instead of computing the improper integral, we recognize that \(\int_0^\infty f(t) \di t = 1.\)

<p>
    In a store or call center, it's imperative to know the average time a customer waits.
    Similarly, an equipment manufacturer must know how long a piece of equipment tends to last.
    These applications motivate the calculation of the <i>mean</i> of a probability density functionâ€”the 
    long-run average value of a random variable \(X.\)
    Let \(y = f(x)\) be a probability density function.
    Suppose that \(N\) numbers are chosen in the interval \([a, b];\) 
    we want to determine the sum of these \(N\) numbers. 
    We split the interval \([a, b]\) into \(n\) subintervals;
    consider one subinterval from \(x_{i - 1}\) to \(x_i.\)
    If \(\overline{x}_i\) is the midpoint of these two numbers, then we assert the following:
    <i>As we pick more and more numbers between \(x_{i - 1}\) and \(x_i,\) then 
    the average of these numbers will approach \(\overline{x}_i.\)</i>
    The probability of picking a number in \([a, b]\)
    and having it land in \([x_{i - 1}, x_i]\) is approximately
    \(f \par{\overline{x}_i} \Delta x,\)
    which is the area of the approximating rectangle in <a href="#probability-avg-value">Figure 3</a>.
    Accordingly, we estimate that the number of values landing in \([x_{i - 1}, x_i]\) is \(N f \par{\overline{x}_i} \Delta x.\)
    Each value is approximately \(\overline{x}_i,\) so the sum of these numbers is roughly
    \[N \, \overline{x}_i f \par{\overline{x}_i} \Delta x \pd\]
    To get the sum of <i>all</i> \(N\) numbers (across all \(n\) subintervals), we add the sums 
    of the numbers in all \(n\) subintervalsâ€”that is, using the sum
    \[\sum_{i = 1}^n N \, \overline{x}_i f \par{\overline{x}_i} \Delta x \pd\]
    This form is a Riemann sum for \(x f(x).\)
    We make each subinterval infinitely small by letting \(n \to \infty\) and \(\Delta x \to 0,\) 
    so the limiting value of this Riemann sum is 
    \[\int_a^b N x f(x) \di x \pd\]
    This is the <i>sum</i> of all \(N\) numbers, so we divide by \(N\) to get the mean \(\mu\) (<i>mu</i>):
    \[\mu = \int_a^b x f(x) \di x \pd\]
    More generally, the <span class="emph">mean of a probability density function</span> \(f(x)\) is given by 
    \begin{equation} 
    \mu = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f(x) \di x \pd \label{eq:avg-X}
    \end{equation}
    This formula asserts that if we choose many values of the continuous random variable \(X,\) then 
    the long-run average of \(X\) will be \(\mu.\)
    Observe that because \(\eqref{eq:avg-X}\) contains an extra term \(x\) in the integrand,
    <span class="warning">the integral does not measure a probability</span>; 
    do not confuse it with \(\eqref{eq:prob-1}.\)

    it follows that \(\int_{-\infty}^0 f(t) \di t = 0.\)
    Thus, we have

<p>
    Since the mean of an exponential probability density function is \(\mu = 1/k\)
    (from <a href="#ex-mean-exp">Example 3</a>), 
    we can rewrite the probability density function in \(\eqref{eq:avg-X}\) as

<p>
    For centuries, statisticians have noticed a peculiar finding in homogeneous populations: Phenomena
    such as intelligence scores, test results, and heights are often distributed symmetrically around a central peak, 
    resembling a <i>bell curve</i>.
    Specifically, a random variable \(X\) in these scenarios follows a <span class="emph">Normal distribution</span>, 
    whose probability density function is
    \begin{equation} 
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \, e^{-(x - \mu)^2/\par{2 \sigma^2}} \pd \label{eq:normal-pdf}
    \end{equation}
    This is one of the most important distributions in statistics,
    with many applications in inferential statistics, probability calculations, and the natural sciences. 
    It turns out that the factor \(1/\par{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}\) is needed to 
    satisfy \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \di x = 1,\) thus enabling \(f\) to be a probability function.
    The mean of this function is \(\mu,\)
    and the parameter \(\sigma\) (<i>sigma</i>) is called the <span class="emph">standard deviation</span>, 
    a measure of variation in the values of \(X.\)
    Low values of \(\sigma\) imply little spread,
    meaning the graph of \(y = f(x)\) tends to be clustered around the mean. 
    Conversely, high values of \(\sigma\) indicate large spread,
    so the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is more flattened around the mean.
    (See <a href="#normal-dist-sd">Figure 4</a>.)

    The <b>68â€“95â€“99.7 Rule</b>

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">The 68â€“95â€“99.7 Rule</span>
    Unfortunately, the function in \(\eqref{eq:normal-pdf}\) has no elementary antiderivative. 
    We must instead use methods such as Riemann sums or Simpson's Rule to approximate integrals 
    with this function. 
    Using such methods produces the following results:
    \[
    \ba 
    \int_{\mu -\sigma}^{\mu + \sigma} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \, e^{-(x - \mu)^2/\par{2 \sigma^2}} \di x &\approx 0.68 \cma\nl 
    \int_{\mu -2\sigma}^{\mu + 2\sigma} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \, e^{-(x - \mu)^2/\par{2 \sigma^2}} \di x &\approx 0.95 \cma \nl
    \int_{\mu -3\sigma}^{\mu + 3\sigma} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \, e^{-(x - \mu)^2/\par{2 \sigma^2}} \di x &\approx 0.997 \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    These results are summarized by the <span class="emph">68â€“95â€“99.7 Rule</span> (also called the <b>Empirical Rule</b>), 
    which says that 
    about \(68\%\) of the data lie within \(1\) standard deviation of the mean, 
    about \(95\%\) of the data lie within \(2\) standard deviations of the mean, and 
    about \(99.7\%\) of the data lie within \(3\) standard deviations of the mean.
    Hence, it is very rare for a random variable \(X\) to lie more than \(3\) standard deviations 
    away from the mean.
    We use the 68â€“95â€“99.7 Rule to estimate probabilities in our heads, as well as how likely an outcome is to occur. 
    In general, statisticians consider significant 
    any value of \(X\) located more than \(2\) standard deviations away from the mean, 
    which has only a \(5\%\) chance to occur.

    <span class="label-emph">The Intelligence Quotient</span>
    A measure of intelligence is the <b>Intelligence Quotient</b> (<b>IQ</b>), 
    whose scores are Normally distributed with a mean of \(\mu = 100\) and a
    standard deviation of \(\sigma = 15.\)
    Substituting these parameters into \(\eqref{eq:normal-pdf}\) 
    gives a probability density function for IQ scores to be 
    \begin{equation} 
    f(x) = \normalPdf{100}{15}{x} \pd \label{eq:iq}
    \end{equation}
    (See <a href="#iq-scores">Figure 5</a>.)
    By the 68â€“95â€“99.7 Rule, we conclude the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            About \(68 \%\) of people have IQs between \(85\) and \(115.\)
        </li>
        <li>
            About \(95 \%\) of people have IQs between \(70\) and \(130.\)
        </li>
        <li>
            About \(99.7 \%\) of people have IQs between \(55\) and \(145.\)
        </li>
    </ul>
    Any IQ lower than \(55\) or higher than \(145\) is therefore very rare.
    It has been estimated that the IQs of some famous physicists and chess players
    are around \(160.\)
    The probability of an individual having an IQ of \(160\) or higher is given by integrating \(\eqref{eq:iq}\)
    from \(x = 160\) to \(x = \infty.\)
    For approximation purposes, we note that nearly nobody has an IQ above \(200\)
    (almost \(6.7\) standard deviations above the mean). 
    So it is safe to replace \(x = \infty\) with \(x = 200,\)
    from which we see
    \[
    \ba 
    P(x \geq 160) &\approx \int_{160}^{200} \normalPdf{100}{15}{x} \di x \nl
    &\approx 3.169 \times 10^{-5} \nl 
    &= 0.003169 \% \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    Thus, out of approximately every \(31500\) people, only one person has an IQ of \(160\) or greater.

            which is more than \(10\) standard deviations away from the mean and is therefore extremely rare.
            Using numerical methods or a calculator, we see
            \[

            P(X \geq 68) &\approx \int_{68}^{90} \normalPdf{64.5}{2.5}{x} \di x \nl
