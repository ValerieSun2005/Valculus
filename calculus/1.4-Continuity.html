    In everyday language, the word <i>continuous</i> might describe a phenomenon that occurs 
    without interruption. 
    But in mathematics, we require a description to have a clear, standard definition. 
    So in this section we provide a formal definition of continuity, explore their uses,
    and learn to classify discontinuities.
    We discuss the following topics:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="#continuity-at-a-point" class="page-anchor">Continuity at a Point</a>

<h4 id="continuity-at-a-point">Continuity at a Point</h4>

    Informally, we say a function \(f\) is <i>continuous</i> at \(a\) 
    if we can trace the curve \(y = f(x)\) 
    near \(x = a\) without lifting our pen. 
    Simply put, \(f\) is continuous at \(a\) if the graph does not have a <q>break</q> at \(x = a.\)
    But formally, we define \(f\) to be <span class="emph">continuous at \(a\)</span> if and only if
    \begin{equation} 
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) \pd \label{eq:cont-point}
    \end{equation}
    This definition requires us to check three conditions:
    <ol class="list-num">
        <li>
            \(f(a)\) is defined.
        </li>
        <li>
            \(\ds \lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) exists.
        </li>
        <li>
            \(\ds \lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) equals \(f(a).\)
        </li>
    </ol>
    As you determine continuity, it's easiest to check these three conditions in order.
    If any condition isn't satisfied, then \(\eqref{eq:cont-point}\) is false
    and so \(f\) is called <span class="emph">discontinuous at \(a.\)</span>
    In this scenario, we'd say \(f\) has a <span class="emph">discontinuity</span> at \(a.\)

    Many phenomena are continuous:
    A plant's height changes continuously with time 
    because its height doesn't increase abruptly. 
    Likewise, 
    a car's position is a continuous function of time
    since the car can't teleport. 
    And the volume of a leaking container 
    decreases continuously due to the laws of physics.

    It's easy to identify discontinuities on a graph, 
    but how do we detect them from equations?
    Let's classify the three types of discontinuities—<i>removable discontinuities</i>, 
    <i>jump discontinuities</i>, and <i>infinite discontinuities</i>.
</p>    
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Removable Discontinuities</span>
    A function \(f(x)\) has a 
    <span class="emph">removable discontinuity</span> (also 
    called a <span class="emph">hole</span>) at  
    at \(x = a\) if \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) exists but does not equal \(f(a).\)
    Alternatively, \(f(a)\) may be undefined. 
    In 
    <a href="#determining-continuity-hole">Figure 1</a>,
    the graph of \(y = f(x)\) has a removable discontinuity at \(x = a\) because 
    \[\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = K \ne f(a) \pd\]
    We call this discontinuity <i>removable</i> because we may fill in the hole at \((a, K)\)
    to restore continuity. 
    By doing so, we construct a new function \(g\) that matches \(f\) but is continuous at \(a\)—namely,
    \[g(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    f(x)  &x \ne a \nl 
    K &x = a \pd
    \end{cases}
    \]

        content:'FIGURE 2';
    }
</style>
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Jump Discontinuities</span>
    The function \(f(x)\) has a 
    <span class="emph">jump discontinuity</span>
    at \(x = a\) 
    if the one-sided limits
    \[\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \and \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)\]
    exist but don't equal each other.
    (See <a href="#determining-continuity-jump">Figure 2</a>.)
    The name is self-explanatory: 
    at \(x = a,\) an abrupt <i>jump</i> interrupts the graph of \(f.\)
</p>
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Infinite Discontinuities</span>
    Lastly, the function \(f(x)\) has an 
    <span class="emph">infinite discontinuity</span>
    at \(x = a\) 
    if either 
    \[\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \or \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)\] 
    is infinite. 
    At \(x = a,\) 
    the graph of \(y = f(x)\) 
    has a <i>vertical asymptote</i>;
    \(f\) is therefore unbounded near the line \(x = a.\) 
    (See <a href="#determining-continuity-infinite">Figure 3</a>.)

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">One-Sided Continuity</span>
    How do we discuss continuity at endpoints?
    To do so, we establish the following definitions:
    \(f\) is <span class="emph">continuous from the left</span> at \(a\)
    if and only if
    \[\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = f(a) \pd\]
    Likewise, \(f\) is <span class="emph">continuous from the right</span> at \(a\)
    if and only if
    \[\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a) \pd\]
    As we communicate mathematical ideas, 
    we must be able to describe a graph's behavior in great detail; 
    these definitions facilitate this goal.

    <a href="#floor-graph">Figure 4</a> shows the graph of this function, 
    which has jump discontinuities at all integers \(n.\)
    (For example, the greatest integer function has a jump discontinuity 
    at the integer \(1\) since \(\lim_{x \to 1^-} \floor x = 0\)
    but \(\lim_{x \to 1^+} \floor x\) <nobr>\(= 1.\))</nobr>
    Yet at each integer \(x = n,\) we see \(\floor x\) 
    is continuous from the right because 
    \[\lim_{x \to n^+} \floor x = n = \floor n \pd\]
    Conversely, \(\floor x\) is <i>discontinuous</i>

    In each problem, let's analyze the relationship between

    <ol class="list-roman">
        <li>
            The numerator of \(f(x)\) is a difference of squares:
            \[x^2 - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4) \pd\]
            We therefore see
            \[
            \ba
            \lim_{x \to -4} f(x) &=
            \lim_{x \to -4} \frac{\cancel{(x + 4)}(x - 4)}{\cancel{x + 4}} \nl

            Thus, 
            \[\lim_{x \to -4^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -4^+} f(x) = -8 \pd\]
            Since both one-sided limits at \(-4\) equal each other
            [but \(f(-4)\) is undefined],
            \(f(x)\) has a <b>removable discontinuity</b> at \(x = -4.\)

    We say \(f\) is continuous over the <i>open</i> interval \((a, b)\)
    because

    We say a function \(f\) is continuous 
    if it is continuous at each point in its domain.
    Many functions are continuous on their domains.
    For example, polynomials are continuous for all real numbers,
    and logarithms are continuous for strictly positive inputs.
    The following table
    provides the intervals of continuity for 
    many functions we've seen: polynomial, rational, radical,
    absolute value, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric,
    and inverse trigonometric.

<p>
    Continuity provides us an important application, the
    <span class="emph">Intermediate Value Theorem</span>:
    If \(f\) is continuous on \([a, b],\)
    then \(f\) <i>takes on every value</i> between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b).\)
    Intuitively, a continuous curve that begins at \((a, f(a))\)
    and ends at \((b, f(b))\) must contain any intermediate point that lies 
    between these endpoints. 
    To express this idea mathematically, 
    we let \(Q\) be any intermediate value between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\)–that is, 
    \(f(a) \leq Q \leq f(b).\) 
    Then the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence 
    of some \(c\) in \([a, b]\) for which \(f(c) = Q.\)
    (See <a href="#ivt-graph">Figure 7</a>.)
    Some functions have multiple values of \(c\) in \([a, b]\) that satisfy 
    the Intermediate Value Theorem; these functions take on the value \(Q\)
    multiple times in \([a, b].\)
    But the Intermediate Value Theorem does <span class="warning">not</span>
    give us a method to find \(c;\) it merely proves the existence of such \(c.\)
</p>

<div class="box-title">INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREM</div>
<div class="box">
    If \(f\) is continuous on \([a, b],\) 
    and \(Q\) is a number between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b),\)

    Since \(f(x)\) is a polynomial, it is continuous for all \(x,\)
    including on \([-1, 2].\)
    Observe that \(f(-1) = 1\) and \(f(2) = 10.\)
    Because \(1 \leq Q \leq 10,\) 
    the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees a number \(c\) in \([-1, 2]\)
    such that \(f(c) = Q,\) that is,
    \[c^3 + 2 = 3 \pd \]
    The only real solution to this equation is \(\boxed{c = 1}.\)

    Note that \(f(0) = -1\) and \(f(1) = 4.\)
    We therefore have \(f(0) \leq 0 \leq f(1);\)
    that is, \(Q = 0\) is a number between \(f(0)\) and \(f(1).\)
    Since \(f\) is a polynomial, it is continuous.
    The Intermediate Value Theorem concludes that 
    a value \(c\) exists in \([0, 1]\)
    such that \(f(c) = 0.\)
    So \(f\) has at least one root between \(0\) and \(1.\)

    <span class="label-emph">Graphing Calculators</span>
    <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/1.4-Continuity.html#ex-ivt-zeros">Example 10</a>
    shows how graphing calculators find zeros:
    The graphing calculator plots two points with opposite \(y\)-values,
    assumes the function is continuous, 
    and connects the points.
    An algorithm enables the calculator to sample many points
    to attain an accurate guess of the zero.
    For example, we could use the Intermediate Value Theorem again in 
    <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/1.4-Continuity.html#ex-ivt-zeros">Example 10</a>
    by noting that \(f(0.2) = -1.18272\) and \(f(0.8) = 0.53472,\)
    so the zero \(c\) must lie in \((0.2, 0.8).\)
    As we repeat this process with \(f(0.5) = -1.125\)
    and \(f(0.75) = 0.04296875,\)
    the Intermediate Value Theorem again asserts that the zero \(c\)
    must lie in \((0.5, 0.75).\)
    We can continue sampling points to attain a narrower 
    interval, thus approaching the true value of \(c.\)
    A computer can iterate this operation many times to get 
    a zero that is accurate to many decimal places.
