<p>
    A fundamental part of calculus is calculating a function's slope at a point.
    This slope represents the function's <i>rate of change</i> at an exact moment. 
    Calculating slopes allows us to delve into the environment of <i>instantaneous rates</i>; 
    we can find how rapidly a population is increasing or how quickly a deflating balloon's radius is shrinking—fundamental 
    skills in the study of <span class="emph">differential calculus</span>.
    The question is, what method do we use to find a function's slope?
</p>
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Geometry with Tangents</span>
    The first half of the answer is to construct a <span class="emph">tangent line</span> to the function's graph.
    This line's slope matches the slope of the function.
    <a href="#tangent-line">Figure 1</a> shows the graph of a function \(f\)   
    and the tangent line to \(f\) at point \(P(x, f(x)),\)
    which "just touches" the graph of \(f\) at \(P.\)
    The slope of \(f\) at \(P\)—and, accordingly, of the tangent line at \(P\)—has slope \(f'(x),\) called a <span class="emph">derivative</span>.
    The derivative \(f'(x)\) measures the <i>rate of change</i> of \(f\) at \(x \col\)
    If \(f\) increases steeply at \(x,\) then \(f'(x)\)—the slope of \(f(x)\)—is a large <i>positive</i> number.
    In contrast, if \(f\) is decreasing at \(x,\) then \(f'(x)\) is <i>negative</i> because the slope of \(f(x)\) is negative.
    We formally define a tangent line using the derivative, as follows.
</p>

<div class="box-title">DEFINITION OF A TANGENT LINE</div>
<div class="box">
    A line is <span class="emph">tangent</span> to the graph of \(f\) at point \(P(x, f(x))\)
    if the line passes through point \(P\) with slope \(f'(x).\)
</div>

<p>
    The tangent line <i>doesn't necessarily</i> only touch the graph once,
    because the line could strike the graph at any point farther away.
    The second part of our question is set: 
    what is our procedure to compute the slope of the tangent line?
</p>

<figure class="secant-line" id="secant-line">

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Calculating a Derivative</span>
    The second half of our answer is to construct a line that <i>collapses into</i>  
    the tangent line, and calculate the slope as the line transforms into a tangent line.
    As in <a href="#secant-line">Figure 2</a>, 
    we construct a <span class="emph">secant line</span> that 
    intersects \(f\) at points \(P\) and \(Q,\)
    both on the graph of \(f.\)
    If the horizontal difference between \(P\) and \(Q\) is \(h,\) 
    then the vertical difference is \(f(x + h) - f(x).\)
    Therefore, the slope of the secant line is 
    \[m_{PQ} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \pd\]
    We call \(m_{PQ}\) a <span class="emph">difference quotient</span> because it's a ratio of two differences.
    If we move \(Q\) along the graph of \(f\) to be closer to \(P\)—that is, if \(h\) 
    shrinks—then the secant line better resembles the tangent line to \(P.\)
    If \(h\) is made <i>infinitely</i> close to \(0,\) 
    then the secant line becomes the tangent line, as in <a href="#anm-1">Animation 1</a>.
    Therefore, we find the slope of the tangent line by taking the <i>limit</i> of \(m_{PQ}\) as \(h \to 0;\) namely,
    \begin{equation} 
    f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \pd \label{eq:lim-defn}  
    \end{equation}
    <figure class="anm-1" id="anm-1">
        <video controls>
            <source src="../images/sectionImages/tangent-animation.mp4" type="video/mp4" alt="Animation 1">

    </figure>
    <style>
        .anm-1::before{
            content:'ANIMATION 1';
        }
    </style>
    And we have accomplished our goal—\(\eqref{eq:lim-defn}\) gives the slope of \(f\) at \(x.\)
    We interpret \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn}\) as a <span class="emph">derivative function</span>, 
    which gives the slope to \(f\) at any input \(x.\)
    Another notation for the derivative is \(\textDeriv{y}{x}\) or \(\textDeriv{f}{x}\)—called 
    <span class="emph">Leibniz</span> notation.
    For example, \(\eqrefer{eq:lim-defn}\) can also be written using Leibniz notation as 
    \[\deriv{f}{x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \pd\]
    Loosely speaking, \(\dd x\) can be thought of as an infinitely small \(\Delta x,\) 
    and \(\dd y\) is similar to an infinitely small \(\Delta y.\)
    We call these expressions <span class="emph">differentials</span>. 
    The slope \(\textDeriv{y}{x}\) is then analogous to the ratio of these differentials.
    We will discuss differentials in later sections;
    for now, we treat derivatives as distinct from fractions.
    The expression \(\textDeriv{y}{x}\) represents the derivative of \(y\) 
    <i>with respect to</i> \(x\)—in other words, the <i>rate</i> at which \(y\)
    changes with \(x.\)
    
</p>

<div class="box-title" id="deriv-function"> DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE (DERIVATIVE FUNCTION) </div>
<div class="box">
    The <span class="emph">derivative</span> of the function \(f\) at \(x\) is \(f'(x),\)
    given by 
    \begin{equation} 
    f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \eqlabel{eq:lim-defn}  
    \end{equation}
    if the limit exists.
    This form is called a <span class="emph">derivative function</span>. 
    The quantity \(f'(x)\) is the <i>slope</i> of \(f\) at the point \((x, f(x)).\)
</div>

<figure class="secant-line-alternate" id="secant-line-alternate">
    <img src="../images/sectionImages/secant-line-alternate.jpg" alt="Fig. 3.">
</figure>
<style>
    .secant-line-alternate::before{
        content:'FIGURE 3';
    }
</style>

<p>
    There is another definition of the derivative.
    If we draw a secant line that intersects the graph of \(f\) at points \(P(a, f(a))\) and \(Q(x, f(x)),\)
    then the secant line's slope is 
    \[m_{PQ} = \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \pd\]
    (See <a href="#secant-line-alternate">Figure 3</a>.)
    Then as \(x\) is made closer to \(a,\) the <i>secant</i> line
    begins to collapse into the <i>tangent</i> line to \(f\) at \(P.\)
    We then get
    \begin{equation} 
    f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \pd \label{eq:lim-defn-point}
    \end{equation} 
    We use \(\eqrefer{eq:lim-defn-point}\) to find a derivative of \(f\) at a <i>specific point</i> \((a, f(a)).\)
    In contrast, \(\eqrefer{eq:lim-defn}\) gives the derivative of \(f\) as
    a <i>function</i> of \(x\)—that is, the slope of \(f\) as a function of \(x.\)
    To find a derivative of a function at a point, 
    we can use either difference quotient in \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn}\) or \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn-point}.\)
    Sometimes one form is easier to use than the other.
</p>

<div class="box-title" id="deriv-point"> DERIVATIVE AT A POINT (ALTERNATE DEFINITION) </div>
<div class="box">
    The derivative of the function \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) is 
    \begin{equation} 
    f'(a) = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \eqlabel{eq:lim-defn-point}
    \end{equation} 
    if this limit exists.
</div>

<aside class="box-remark">
    The verb for taking a derivative is 
    <i>differentiate</i>, not <i>derive</i>.
    To <i>derive</i> is to obtain an idea based on another concept—for example, 
    <i>deriving</i> an equation from another equation.
</aside>

<p>
    We pronounce \(\textDeriv{y}{x}\) as "\(\dd y\) by \(\dd x\)" or simply "\(\dd y,\) \(\dd x.\)"
    Using Leibniz notation, we can also write 
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = \deriv{}{x} [y] \pd\]
    The expression \(\textDeriv{}{x}\) is an <i>operator</i>, whereas \(\textDeriv{y}{x}\) is a quantity.
    An analogy is as follows: \(\textDeriv{}{x}\) is a verb, and \(\textDeriv{y}{x}\) is a noun.
    To denote the derivative of \(y = f(x)\) at a point \(x = a,\) 
    in Leibniz notation we write \(\textDeriv{f}{x}|_{x = a}\) or \(\textDeriv{y}{x}|_{x = a},\)
    and in prime notation we write \(f'(a)\) or \(y'(a).\) 
    Taking a derivative is called <span class="emph">differentiation</span>.

        If a limit expression contains nested fractions, 
        then it may be easier to write the expression as a product of two terms—for example, 
        \[\frac{\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{2}}{x - 2} = \frac{1}{x - 2} \left(\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{2}\right) \pd\]
    </aside>
    <p>
        We seek the derivative at a specific point.
        Hence, we can use either \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn}\) or \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn-point},\) with \(x = 2.\)
        If we use \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn-point},\) then \(f(x) = 1/x\) and \(f(2) = 1/2,\) and
        \[f'(2) = \lim_{x \to 2} \frac{1}{x - 2} \left(\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{2}\right) \pd\]
        We cannot perform direct substitution by immediately substituting \(x = 2,\)
        because this limit is of the indeterminate form \(\indZero.\)
        Our strategy is then to combine the fractions using a common denominator and attempt to cancel a common factor. 
        (See Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/1.2-Evaluating-Limits-Analytically.html">1.2</a> 
        for a review of finding indeterminate limits.)
        Doing so gives 
        \[

        We interpret this value as follows: The tangent line to the graph of \(y = 1/x\) at \(x = 2\) 
        has a slope of \(-1/4.\) 
        (See <a href="#deriv-ex-1-over-x">Figure 4</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        If we chose to use \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn}\) to find \(f'(2),\) then our limit would have been 
        \[f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{h} \left(\frac{1}{2 + h} - \frac{1}{2}\right) \pd\]
        You may verify that this limit also equals \(-1/4,\) 
        matching the answer we obtained using \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn-point}.\)

<p>
    If \(f'(a)\) is defined,
    then we say function \(f\) is <span class="emph">differentiable</span> at \(a.\)
    We call a <i>function</i> differentiable if its derivative is defined at each point in its domain.
    Differentiability implies continuity:
    if \(f\) is differentiable at \(a,\)
    then \(f\) is continuous at \(a.\)
    But the converse statement is <span class="warning">not</span> necessarily true—a 
    function can be continuous but not differentiable at a point.
    <i>All</i> differentiable functions are continuous, 
    but <span class="warning">not</span> all continuous functions are differentiable.
</p>


<p>
    A derivative may fail to exist for several reasons:
    If \(f\) is discontinuous at \(a,\) 
    then \(f'(a)\) doesn't exist because differentiability requires continuity. 
    If \(f\) is continuous at \(a,\) then \(f'(a)\) fails to exist 
    <ul>
        <li>
            if at \(x = a\) the <span class="emph">left-hand</span> derivative and 
            <span class="emph">right-hand</span> derivative of \(f\) don't match; or 
        </li>
        <li>
            if \(f\) has a vertical tangent line at \(x = a.\)
        </li>
    </ul> 
    Just as the limit at a point doesn't exist if the one-sided limits don't match, 
    the derivative at a point doesn't exist if the left- and right-hand derivatives aren't equivalent.
    If \(f\) has a sharp turn or cusp at \(x = a,\) 
    then the one-sided derivatives are not equivalent.
    For example, the function \(|x|\) is <span class="warning">not</span> 
    differentiable at \(x = 0,\) as its graph
    has a sharp corner at \(x = 0\) (<a href="#deriv-abs-value-graph">Figure 5</a>).
    The slope of \(|x|\) is \(-1\) for \(x \lt 0\) and \(1\) for \(x \gt 0;\)
    therefore, the derivative function of \(|x|\) is 
    \[
    \deriv{}{x} |x| = 
    \begin{cases}
    -1 & x \lt 0 \nl 
    1 & x \gt 0 \pd
    \end{cases}
    \]
    Hence, at \(x = 0\) the <i>left</i>-hand derivative of \(|x|\) is \(-1\)
    and the <i>right</i>-hand derivative is \(1.\)
    These values don't match, so \(\textDeriv{}{x} \, |x|\) is undefined at \(x = 0.\)
    On the other hand, the derivative of \(\sqrt[3]{x}\) at \(x = 0\) is undefined 
    since the graph of \(y = \sqrt[3]{x}\) has a <i>vertical tangent</i> at \(x = 0.\)

        The key idea is that \(f'(x)\) is the <i>slope</i> of \(f(x).\)
        We want to identify the intervals over which \(f\) is increasing or decreasing.
        We make the following remarks:
        <ul>
            <li>
                \(f(x)\) has <i>horizontal</i> tangent lines when \(x = -1\) and \(x = 1.\)
                Since these lines each have slope \(0,\)
                \(f'(-1) = f'(1) = 0.\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f(x)\) is <i>increasing</i> over \(-3 \leq x \leq -1\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 3.\)
                Thus, \(f'\)—the slope of \(f\)—is positive for \(-3 \lt x \lt -1\) and \(1 \lt x \lt 3.\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f(x)\) is <i>decreasing</i> over \(-1 \leq x \leq 1.\)
                Accordingly, \(f'\) is negative for \(-1 \lt x \lt 1.\)
            </li>
        </ul>

    The derivative of any constant \(c\) is \(0.\)
    We affirm this result geometrically because the graph of \(y = c\) 
    is flat and therefore has a slope of \(0\) at all points (<a href="#deriv-graph-uniform">Figure 10</a>).
    The proof of this fact is as follows.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="proof">PROOF</span> Let \(f(x) = c,\) where \(c\) is a constant.
    We want to prove that \(f'(x) = 0.\)
    Using \(\eqrefer{eq:lim-defn},\) both \(f(x)\) and \(f(x + h)\)
    equal \(c\) because \(f(x)\) does not depend on \(x.\)
    Thus, we have  
    \begin{align*} 
    f'(x) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c - c}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{0}{h} \nl 
    &= 0 \pd 
    \end{align*}
    \[\qedproof\]
    Note that the limit \(\lim_{h \to 0} (0/h)\) is 
    <span class="warning">not</span> in the indeterminate form \(\indZero,\)
    since the numerator is <i>fixed</i> at \(0.\)
</p>

<aside class="box-remark">
    Recall function notation:
    \((f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x),\)
    and \((f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x).\)
    Hence, \((f \pm g)'(x) = \left[f(x) \pm g(x) \right]'.\)
</aside>

<p>
    If \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable, and \(c\) is a constant, then the following properties hold:
    <ul>
        <li>
            \([cf(x)]' = c f'(x).\)
        </li>
        <li>
            \((f + g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x).\)
        </li>
        <li>
            \((f - g)'(x) = f'(x) - g'(x).\)
        </li>
    </ul>
    We can also write these properties in Leibniz notation as, respectively, 
    \[
    \ba 
    &\deriv{}{x} \parbr{cf(x)} = c \deriv{}{x}[f(x)] \nl 
    &\deriv{}{x} \parbr{f(x) + g(x)} = \deriv{}{x} [f(x)] + \deriv{}{x} [g(x)] \nl 
    &\deriv{}{x} \parbr{f(x) - g(x)} = \deriv{}{x} [f(x)] - \deriv{}{x} [g(x)] \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    In words, the derivative of a function multiplied by a constant 
    is the constant multiplied by the derivative. 
    Also, the derivative of a sum is the sum of derivatives, 
    and the derivative of a difference is the difference of derivatives.
    The proofs of these properties are as follows.

    The limit definition of \([cf(x)]'\) is 
    \[[cf(x)]' = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[cf(x + h)] - [cf(x)]}{h} \pd\]
    We need to show that this form equals \(c f'(x).\) 
    We factor out \(c \col\) 
    \[

    A visual interpretation of this property is shown by <a href="#deriv-slope-scale">Figure 11</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="proof">PROOF</span>
    The limit definition of \((f + g)'(x)\) is 
    \[(f + g)'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[f(x + h) + g(x + h)] - [f(x) + g(x)]}{h} \pd\]
    We regroup the terms in the numerator and split the limit by the Sum Law for Limits. 
    (See Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/1.2-Evaluating-Limits-Analytically.html">1.2</a> for a review of limit properties.)
    We find 
    \[
    \ba 
    (f + g)'(x) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[f(x + h) - f(x)] + [g(x + h) - g(x)]}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} + \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h} \nl 
    &= f'(x) + g'(x) \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    Similarly, the limit definition of \((f - g)'(x)\) is 
    \[(f - g)'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[f(x + h) - g(x + h)] - [f(x) - g(x)]}{h} \pd\]
    Rearranging and splitting the limit, using the Difference Law for Limits, give 
    \[
    \ba 
    (f - g)'(x) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[f(x + h) - f(x)] - [g(x + h) - g(x)]}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} - \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(x + h) - g(x)}{h} \nl 
    &= f'(x) - g'(x) \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    Hence, \((f + g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)\) and \((f - g)'(x) = f'(x) - g'(x).\)

            By the Sum Rule for Derivatives,

            at \(x = 2\) the slope of \(f\) is \(-1/2\) and the slope of \(g\) is \(-2.\)

            At \(x = -3,\) the slope of \(f\) is \(0\)
            and the slope of \(g\) is \(1.\)
            Thus, \(f'(-3) = 0\) and \(g'(-3) = 1,\) so

            At \(x = -1\) the slope of \(f\) is \(-1/2.\)
            We therefore have

        Likewise, at \(x = 2\) the right-hand derivative of \(g\) is \(\textDeriv{}{x} \, [x^2 + 3]_{x = 2},\)
        which is 
        \[
        \ba 
        \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{[(2 + h)^2 + 3] - [(2)^2 + 3]}{h} 
        &= \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{4h + h^2}{h} \nl 
        &= \lim_{h \to 0^+} (4 + h) \nl 
        &= 4 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        Since both one-sided derivatives of \(g\) at \(2\) are equivalent, \(g'(2)\) exists. 
        Hence, \(g(x)\) is differentiable at \(x = 2.\)
        The graph of \(y = g(x)\) is shown by <a href="#deriv-piecewise">Figure 13</a>.

<h4 id="higher-order-derivatives">Higher-Order Derivatives</h4>
<p>
    Physical scenarios often exhibit <i>higher-order</i> derivatives. 
    We denote the second derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) as \(\textDeriv{^2y}{x^2};\) that is, 
    \[\deriv{^2 y}{x^2} = \deriv{}{x} \left(\deriv{y}{x} \right) \pd\]
    The \(n\)th derivative of \(y\) is \(\textDeriv{^n y}{x^n}.\)
    (Be careful of the superscript position.)
    In prime notation the second derivative of \(y = f(x)\) with respect to \(x\) is \(f''(x)\) or \(y''(x),\)
    and the \(n\)th derivative is \(f^{(n)}(x)\) or \(y^{(n)}(x).\)
    [Do <span class="warning">not</span> write \(f^{n}(x).\)]
    The key to taking higher-order derivatives is to differentiate incrementally:
    Differentiate once to determine the first derivative, 
    and then differentiate the resulting expression to find the second derivative. 
    Repeat this process as many times as necessary.
</p>
<p>
    Another notation for the derivative is the <i>dot</i> notation, named after Isaac Newton.
    This form solely denotes a derivative with respect to time; 
    for example, the derivative of \(y\) with respect to time is \(\dot y.\)
    Likewise, the second derivative of \(y\) with respect to time is \(\ddot y.\)
    This notation is most commonly used in physics.

    The key idea is to compute the derivatives one at a time.
    Using \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn}\) gives the first derivative of \(g\) to be
    \[
    \ba 
    g'(x) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[3(x + h)^2 - 5] - [3x^2 - 5]}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[3(x^2 + 2xh + h^2) - 5] - [3x^2 - 5]}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{6xh + 3h^2}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \, (6x + 3h) \nl 
    &= 6x \pd 
    \ea 
    \]
    The <i>second</i> derivative of \(g\) is then \(\textDeriv{}{x} \, [6x].\)
    We use \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn}\) to obtain 
    \[
    \ba 
    g''(x) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{6(x + h) - 6x}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{6h}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} 6 \nl 
    &= \boxed{6}
    \ea 
    \]
    See <a href="#deriv-g">Figure 14</a> for the graphs of \(g,\) \(g',\) and \(g''.\)
    Note that since \(g'\) has a constant slope, \(g''\) is uniform.

<h4 id="pos-vel-acc">Position, Velocity, and Acceleration</h4>

<p>
    We define an object's <span class="emph">position</span> to be how far the object is 
    from a reference point. 
    If \(s(t)\) gives an object's position at time \(t,\)
    then the object's <span class="emph">velocity</span> \(v(t)\) is 
    the rate at which the object's position changes with respect to time—that is, 
    \begin{equation}
    v(t) = \deriv{s}{t} \pd \label{eq:v(t)-deriv}
    \end{equation}  
    Velocity is an object's speed in a certain direction; 
    we choose an axis orientation such that one direction is positive and the other is negative.
    For example, if we select east to be the positive direction, then a car driving east has <i>positive</i> velocity, 
    while a car driving west has <i>negative</i> velocity.
    \(\eqrefer{eq:v(t)-deriv}\) gives the rate at which an object's position changes at an instant.
    Accordingly, we can call \(v(t)\) the object's <i>instantaneous</i> velocity.
    The rate at which velocity changes with respect to time is <span class="emph">acceleration</span>, \(a(t)\)—namely, 
    \begin{equation}
    a(t) = \deriv{v}{t} = \deriv{^2 s}{t^2} \pd \label{eq:a(t)-deriv}
    \end{equation}
    Suppose that you're driving a car and the positive direction of motion is the direction you're facing.
    The car's velocity increases when you step on the gas pedal, so the car is accelerating.
    In contrast, pressing the brake pedal decreases the car's velocity, thus decelerating the car.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Units</span>
    Since velocity is the rate at which position is changing with time, 
    the unit of velocity is the position unit <i>per</i> time unit.
    Similarly, acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes with time, 
    so the unit of acceleration is the velocity unit per time unit. 
    For example, if position is measured in meters and time is measured in seconds, 
    then the velocity's unit is meters per second. 
    Likewise, acceleration's unit is meters per second per second, or meters per second squared.

        By \(\eqrefer{eq:v(t)-deriv}\) the particle's velocity function is the derivative of position with respect to time—namely, 
        \(v(t) = s'(t).\)
        We seek the derivative of position as a function, so we use \(\eqref{eq:lim-defn}\) to get 
        \[
        \ba 
        v(t) &= s'(t) \nl

        &= \lim_{h \to 0} (6t + h) \nl 
        &= 6t \pd

        The particle's acceleration function is, by \(\eqref{eq:a(t)-deriv},\) 
        the derivative of the velocity function. Hence, \(a(t) = v'(t) = \textDeriv{}{t} \, [6t].\)
        We obtain 
        \[
        \ba 
        a(t) &= v'(t) \nl 
        &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{6(t + h) - 6t}{h} \nl 
        &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{6h}{h} \nl 
        &= \lim_{h \to 0} 6 \nl 
        &= 6 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        The particle's acceleration function is therefore \(a(t) = 6.\)

        Their domains are each \(t \geqslant 0\) since time can't be negative.
        When \(t = 2,\) the particle's velocity is \(v(2) = 12\) inches per minute
