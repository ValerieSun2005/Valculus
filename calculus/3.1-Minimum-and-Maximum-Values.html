    Efficiency drives the need for models to be be minimized or maximized.
    For example, a bank may wish to maximize its profits while minimizing 
    its customers' waiting times.
    The process of maximizing or minimizing a real-world quantity is called 
    <i>optimization</i>, 
    which we will study in depth in 
    Section 
    <a href="/Valculus/calculus/3.6-Optimization.html">3.6</a>.
    In this section we set the foundations by defining minimum and maximum values 
    and learning how to find them.
    We discuss the following topics:

<p>
    Locating the <span class="emph">extrema</span>—the minimum and maximum values—of 
    a function is a vital skill in calculus.
    Let's begin with definitions.
    In <a href="#min-max-abs-max">Figure 1</a> 
    we say \(g(1) = 8/3\) is the <i>absolute minimum</i> value of \(g\) because \((1, 8/3)\) is the <i>lowest</i> point on the graph. 
    Conversely, \(g(3) = 4\) is the <i>absolute maximum</i> value of \(g\) because \((3, 4)\) is the <i>highest</i> point on the graph.
    Both \(g(1)\) and \(g(3)\) are called <i>extrema</i> of \(f.\)
    We formally define these terms as follows.
</p>


<div class="box-title"> ABSOLUTE EXTREMA </div>
<div class="box">
    If \(c\) is some number in the domain \(D\) of a function \(f,\) 
    then \(f(c)\) is the
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="emph">absolute maximum</span> 
            (or <span class="emph">global maximum</span>)
            value of \(f\) 
            if \(f(c) \geq f(x)\) for all \(x\) in \(D.\)
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="emph">absolute minimum</span> 
            (or <span class="emph">global minimum</span>)
            value of \(f\) 
            if \(f(c) \leq f(x)\) for all \(x\) in \(D.\)
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    Many functions have both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum,
    but some have just one or neither. 
    The following examples demonstrate these cases.

    As shown in <a href="#min-max-x2">Figure 2</a>, 
    the <i>absolute minimum</i> value of \(f(x) = x^2\) is \(f(0) = 0.\)

    no <i>absolute maximum</i> value.

    <span class="label-emph">Relative Extrema</span>
    The graphs of many functions have peaks and troughs.
    As an example, the graph of \(y = f(x)\) in <a href="#local-extrema-graph">Figure 4</a>
    has a <i>peak</i> at \((C, f(C))\) 
    and a <i>trough</i> at \((B, f(B)).\)
    We call \(f(C)\) a <span class="emph">relative maximum</span> value of \(f\)
    because \(f(C)\) is the largest value for \(x\) near \(C.\) 
    Similarly, \(f(B)\) is a <span class="emph">relative minimum</span> value of \(f\)
    since \(f(B)\) is the smallest value for \(x\) near \(B.\)
    But these numbers are <span class="warning">not</span> <i>absolute</i> extrema of \(f.\)
    Instead, \(f(A)\) is the <i>absolute maximum</i> value of \(f\)
    and \(f(D)\) is the <i>absolute minimum</i> value of \(f.\) 
    Formally, we define <span class="emph">relative extrema</span> as follows.
</p>

<div class="box-title">RELATIVE EXTREMA</div>
<div class="box">
    The value \(f(c)\) is a 
    <ul>

<p>
    The term <span class="emph">local extremum</span>
    is interchangeable with <i>relative extremum.</i>
    When we say <q>\(x\) <i>near</i> \(c,\)</q>
    we mean it is true on an open interval containing \(c.\)
    In <a href="#local-extrema-graph">Figure 4</a>
    \(f(B)\) is a relative minimum value of \(f\)
    since it's the smallest value of \(f\) on some open interval containing \(B\)—say,
    \((B - \delta, B + \delta)\) for sufficiently small \(\delta \gt 0.\)

    The range of cosine is \([-1, 1].\)
    The graph of \(y = \cos x\) hits its absolute maximum (and relative maximum) value of \(1\) 
    infinitely many times because \(\cos(2n \pi) = 1\)
    for any integer \(n.\) 
    Similarly, the function takes on its absolute minimum (and relative minimum) value of \(-1\)
    infinitely many times since \(\cos [(2n + 1) \pi] = -1.\)
    (See <a href="#extrema-cos-ex">Figure 6</a>.)
</div>

<p>
    Next we discuss a function's extrema on a closed interval. 
    Instead of considering an entire graph, 
    what if we just examine a portion?
    For example, in 
    <a href="/Valculus/calculus/3.1-Minimum-and-Maximum-Values.html#ex-extrema-x3">Example 2</a>
    we concluded that \(f(x) = x^3\) has no absolute extrema over its domain, \(\RR.\)
    But over the closed interval \([-1, 1],\) the absolute minimum of \(f(x) = x^3\)
    is \(f(-1) = -1\) and the absolute maximum is \(f(1) = 1.\)
    It therefore appears that any continuous function must have both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum
    <i>over a closed interval</i>. 
    This observation turns out to be true by the <span class="emph">Extreme Value Theorem</span>,
    defined below.
</p>

<div class="box-title"> EXTREME VALUE THEOREM </div>
<div class="box">
    If \(f\) is continuous over \([a, b],\) 
    then \(f\) attains an absolute minimum value \(f(c)\) and an absolute maximum value \(f(d),\)
    where \(c\) and \(d\) are in \([a, b].\)
</div>

<figure class="evt-not-satisfied" id="evt-not-satisfied">

</figure>
<style>
    .evt-not-satisfied::before{
        content:'FIGURE 7';
    }
</style>

<p>
    While intuitive, the Extreme Value Theorem turns out to be 
    difficult to prove,
    so we omit the proof.
    Extreme values can be taken on more than once,
    as shown by 
    <a href="/Valculus/calculus/3.1-Minimum-and-Maximum-Values.html#ex-extrema-cos">Example 4</a>.
    We emphasize that both conditions of the Extreme Value Theorem—continuity and closed interval—must be satisfied. 
    If either is omitted, then a function is <span class="warning">not</span> guaranteed 
    to have any extrema.
    As an example, the graph of \(y = f(x)\) in 
    <a href="#evt-not-satisfied">Figure 7</a>
    is discontinuous and undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 3.\)
    Thus, the Extreme Value Theorem bestows <i>no guarantees</i> 
    that \(f\) has any extrema. 
    Indeed, \(f\) has neither an absolute minimum nor an absolute maximum 
    on \([0, 3].\)  
</p>


<h4 id="locating-extrema">Locating Extrema</h4>

<p>
    A connection exists between a function's extrema and its derivatives. 
    As shown in
    <a href="#graph-extrema-horiz-tangent">Figure 8</a>, 
    the graph of \(y = f(x)\) has horizontal tangents at the relative minimum \((c, f(c))\) 
    and at the relative maximum \((d, f(d)).\) 
    Because the derivative is the slope of the tangent line, 
    which is \(0,\)
    it follows that \(f'(c) = 0\) and \(f'(d) = 0.\)
    Simply put, the function's derivative equals \(0\) at a relative extremum.
    By <span class="emph">Fermat's Theorem</span>, defined below, 
    this observation is always true for differentiable functions.
</p>

<div class="box-title">FERMAT'S THEOREM</div>
<div class="box">
    If \(f\) has a relative extremum at \(c\) 
    and \(f'(c)\) exists, then \(f'(c) = 0.\)
</div>

<p>
    <span class="proof">PROOF</span>
    First suppose that \(f\) is differentiable at \(c.\)
    Then by the limit definition of a derivative 
    (Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/2.1-Defining-a-Derivative.html">2.1</a>),
    \[
    \ba
    f'(c) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h} \nl 
    &= \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h} \nl
    &= \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h} \pd
    \ea
    \]
    (A limit exists if and only if the one-sided limits exist and equal each other.)
    Next suppose that \(f\) has a relative maximum at \(c.\)
    Then \(f(c) \geq f(x)\) for \(x\) sufficiently close to \(c.\)
    Formally, if \(h\) is sufficiently close to \(0,\)
    with \(h\) either positive or negative, then 
    \begin{flalign}
    &&f(c) &\geq f(c + h) \nonum &\nl
    \laWord{so} && f(c + h) - f(c) &\leq 0 \pd \label{eq:f-c-h-inequality}
    \end{flalign}
    For positive \(h,\) dividing both sides of \(\eqref{eq:f-c-h-inequality}\) by \(h\)
    yields 
    \[
    \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h} \leq 0 \pd
    \]
    Taking the right-hand limit of both sides, we get 
    \[
    \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h} \leq \underbrace{\lim_{h \to 0^+} 0}_0 \pd
    \]
    But the limit on the left is simply \(f'(c),\)
    so we have \(f'(c) \leq 0.\)
    Conversely, if \(h \lt 0\) then we flip the inequality sign in \(\eqref{eq:f-c-h-inequality}\)
    after dividing by \(h \col\)
    \[\frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h} \geq 0 \pd\]
    Taking the left-hand limits of both sides produces 
    \[
    \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h} \geq \underbrace{\lim_{h \to 0^-} 0}_0 \pd
    \]
    Yet the left side is \(f'(c),\)
    so we attain 
    \(f'(c) \geq 0.\)
    Accordingly, we have \(f'(c) \geq 0\) and \(f'(c) \leq 0;\)
    both can only be true if \(f'(c) = 0.\)
    Thus, Fermat's Theorem is proved for the case of a relative maximum at \(c.\)
    Proving Fermat's Theorem for the case of a relative minimum is performed similarly.
    \[\qedproof\]
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-caution">CAUTION</span>
    The converse of Fermat's Theorem is
    <span class="warning">not</span> generally true:
    Just because \(f'(c) = 0\) does not mean \(f\) has a relative extremum at \(c.\)
    For example, if \(f(x) = x^3\) then \(f'(x) = 3x^2\) and \(f'(0) = 0.\)
    But \(x^3\) does <span class="warning">not</span> 
    have an extremum at \(x = 0,\)
    as discussed in 
    <a href="/Valculus/calculus/3.1-Minimum-and-Maximum-Values.html#ex-extrema-x3">Example 2</a>.
</p>

<figure class="graph-abs-x" id="graph-abs-x">
    <img src="../images/sectionImages/graph-abs-x.jpg" alt="Figure 9">
</figure>
<style>
    .graph-abs-x::before{
        content:'FIGURE 9';
    }
</style>

<p>
    Instead, Fermat's Theorem says \(f\) <i>could have</i> a relative extrema at \(c\)
    if \(f'(c) = 0.\)
    Yet \(f\) may also have an extremum at \(c\) when \(f'(c)\) does not exist. 
    For example, \(g(x) = \abs x\) has an absolute minimum (and a relative minimum) value
    at \(x = 0,\) even though \(g'(0)\) is undefined
    (<a href="#graph-abs-x">Figure 9</a>). 
    Thus, to find the relative extrema of \(f,\) our objective is clear:
    <i>We examine points at which \(f'(c) = 0\) or \(f'(c)\) does not exist</i>. 
    We call these \(c\) <span class="emph">critical numbers</span>,
    and the point \((c, f(c))\) is a <span class="emph">critical point</span>.
</p>

<div class="box-title">CRITICAL NUMBERS</div>
<div class="box">
    If \(c\) is in the domain of \(f,\)
    and \(f'(c) = 0\) or \(f'(c)\) does not exist, 
    then \(c\) is a <span class="emph">critical number</span> 
    of \(f.\)
    The point \((c, f(c))\) is a <span class="emph">critical point</span>.
</div>

<p>
    Thus, we can rephrase Fermat's Theorem as follows:
    if \(f\) has a relative extremum at \(c,\)
    then \(c\) is a critical number of \(f.\)
    Accordingly, finding a function's critical numbers allows us 
    to locate its relative extrema.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="text-caution">CAUTION</span>
    It is easy to forget that \(c\) must be within the domain of \(f.\)
    For example, the derivative of \(f(x) = 1/x\) is \(f'(x) = -1/x^2,\)
    which is undefined at \(x = 0.\) But since \(f(0)\) is <i>also</i> undefined, 
    \(0\) is <span class="warning">not</span> a critical number of \(f.\)
</p>

<div class="example-title"> EXAMPLE 5 </div>
<div class="example">
    <div class="example-problem">

    Applying the Power Rule and rearranging,
    we attain
    \[
    \ba
    f'(x) &= 12 x^{-1/5} - 9 x^{4/5} \nl  
    &= \frac{12}{x^{1/5}} - \frac{9 x^{5/5}}{x^{1/5}} \nl 
    &= \frac{12 - 9x}{x^{1/5}} \pd
    \ea
    \]
    We see \(f'(x) = 0\) when \(12 - 9x = 0\)—that is, 
    when \(x = 4/3.\)
    Also, \(f'(x)\) is undefined when \(x = 0.\)
    Because both numbers are within the domain of \(f,\)
    the critical numbers are \(\boxed{0}\) and \(\boxed{4/3}.\)
    <a href="#graph-crit-numbers-ex">Figure 10</a> shows the graph of \(y = f(x);\)
    its relative extrema are at the critical numbers, \(x = 0\) and \(x = 4/3.\)
</div>

<p>
    We now present a coherent strategy for locating <i>absolute</i> extrema:
    If \(f\) is continuous over \([a, b],\)
    then \(f\) has both an absolute minimum value and an absolute maximum value in \([a, b]\)
    by the Extreme Value Theorem.
    The absolute extrema of \(f\) must either match the relative extrema
    or reside at the endpoints.
    Hence, the endpoints and critical numbers are possible locations of absolute extrema,

<p>
    We now discuss how to find the 
    <i>relative minima</i> and <i>relative maxima</i> of a function \(f.\)
    (These terms are also called <i>local extrema</i>.)  
    Graphically, these points represent troughs and peaks, respectively, of the graph of \(y = f(x).\) 
    In <a href="#min-max-deriv-sign-change">Figure 4</a>, 
    Point \(A\) is the location of a relative minimum of \(f,\)
    whereas Point \(B\) is the location of a relative maximum of \(f.\)
</p>
<p>
    Points \(A\) and \(B\) are both critical points because \(f' = 0\) at each point.
    At Point \(A\) the sign of \(f'\) flips from negative to positive.
    Conversely, at Point \(B,\) \(f'\) changes sign from positive to negative.
    We then see the following: If \(x = c\) is a critical number of \(f(x),\) then
    <ul>
        <li>
            \(f\) has a <span class="emph">relative minimum</span> at \(c\) if 
            \(f'\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(c.\)
        </li>
        <li>
            \(f\) has a <span class="emph">relative maximum</span> at \(c\) if 
            \(f'\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(c.\)
        </li>
        <li>
            \(f\) has neither a relative minimum nor relative maximum at \(c\) if 
            \(f'\) does not change sign at \(c.\)
        </li>
    </ul>
    We call these guidelines the <span class="emph">First-Derivative Test</span>.
    For example, the derivative of \(g(x) = x^3\) is \(g'(x) = 3x^2,\) satisfying \(g'(0) = 0.\) 
    Therefore, \(x = 0\) is a critical number of \(g.\)
    But \(g'(x) = 3x^2 \geq 0,\) so \(g'\) does not change sign at \(x = 0.\)
    Hence, \(x = 0\) is <i>not</i> a relative extremum of \(g\) (see <a href="#min-max-x3">Figure 3</a>).

    By the First-Derivative Test, a critical number \(c\) is a relative extremum of \(g\) if \(g'\) changes sign at \(c.\)
    We find the critical numbers of \(g\) by letting \(g'(x) = 0 \col\)
    \[
    \ba

    6x(x - 1) &= 0 \nl

    Now we analyze the sign changes of \(g'\) at each of these critical numbers.
    In so doing, it's helpful to use the factored form, \(g'(x) = 6x(x - 1).\) 
    <ul>
        <li>
            For \(x \lt 0,\) \(g' \gt 0;\)

            Therefore, because \(g'\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(x = 0,\) 
            the First-Derivative Test asserts that \(g(x)\) has a relative maximum when \(x = 0.\)
            We conclude that \(g(0) = -1\) is a
