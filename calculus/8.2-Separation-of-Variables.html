    We have interpreted differential equations 
    and verified whether a function satisfies a differential equation. 
    In this section, we find functions that satisfy a differential equation;
    this procedure is called <i>solving a differential equation</i>.

<h4 id="separable-diff-eqs">Separable Differential Equations</h4>

<p>
    A <span class="emph">separable differential equation</span>
    is a first-order differential equation in the form 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{x} = \frac{g(x)}{h(y)} \pd \label{eq:sep-diff-eq}
    \end{equation}
    We isolate the \(y\) terms on one side and all the \(x\) terms on the other; 
    this procedure is called solving by <span class="emph">Separation of Variables</span>.  
    In \(\eqref{eq:sep-diff-eq},\) multiplying both sides by \(h(y) \di x\) gives 
    \[h(y) \di y = g(x) \di x \pd\]
    We then take the integral of both sides:
    \begin{equation} 
    \int h(y) \di y = \int g(x) \di x \pd \label{eq:sep-diff-eq-int}
    \end{equation}
    The differential equation in \(\eqref{eq:sep-diff-eq}\) is solved by 
    \(\eqrefer{eq:sep-diff-eq-int}.\)
</p>

<div class="box-title">SEPARATION OF VARIABLES</div>
<div class="box">
    A <span class="emph">separable differential equation</span> is of the form

    \end{equation*}
    <span class="emph">Separation of Variables</span> gives the following solution

<p>
    <span class="proof">PROOF</span>
    To prove the validity of Separation of Variables, we must show that 
    \(\eqref{eq:sep-diff-eq-int}\) satisfies \(\eqref{eq:sep-diff-eq}.\)
    Let's perform Implicit Differentiation (from Section 
    <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/2.5-Implicit-Differentiation-and-Differentiating-Inverse-Functions.html">2.5</a>) 
    on \(\eqref{eq:sep-diff-eq-int} \col\)
    We differentiate both sides with respect to \(x,\)
    use the Chain Rule on the left side, and solve for \(\textderiv{y}{x}.\)
    Doing so shows
    \[
    \ba 
    \deriv{}{x} \int h(y) \di y &= \deriv{}{x} \int g(x) \di x \nl 
    \deriv{}{y} \par{\int h(y) \di y} \deriv{y}{x} &= g(x) \nl 
    h(y) \deriv{y}{x} &= g(x) \pd 
    \ea 
    \]
    Then we find \(\textDeriv{y}{x} = g(x)/h(y),\) which is \(\eqref{eq:sep-diff-eq}.\)
    Hence, \(\eqref{eq:sep-diff-eq-int}\) satisfies \(\eqref{eq:sep-diff-eq};\)
    Separation of Variables is therefore justifiable.

    This differential equation is <b>separable</b> because we can isolate all the <nobr>\(y\)'s</nobr> 
    on one side and all the <nobr>\(x\)'s</nobr> on the other.
    Multiplying both sides by \(y^2 \di x\) gives 
    \[y^2 \di y = 2x \di x \pd\]
    Now we integrate both sides, as follows: 
    \[
    \ba
    \int y^2 \di y &= \int 2x \di x \nl
    \tfrac{1}{3} y^3 + C_1 &= x^2 + C_2 \cma
    \ea
    \]
    where \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) are both arbitrary constants. 
    But for simplicity, we combine these constants into one 
    by letting \(C = C_2 - C_1.\)
    We therefore have
    \[\tfrac{1}{3} y^3 = x^2 + C \pd\]
    Finally, we solve for \(y \col\)
    \[y = \sqrt[3]{3x^2 + 3C} \pd\]
    Since \(C\) is an arbitrary constant, \(3C\) is also an arbitrary constant; 
    we can therefore write \(3C\) as simply \(C.\)
    Our general solution is then 
    \[\boxed{y = \sqrt[3]{3x^2 + C}}\]

    We perform Separation of Variables by isolating all the <nobr>\(y\)'s</nobr> on the left side 
    and all the <nobr>\(x\)'s</nobr> on the right side. 
    Note that \(y' = \textDeriv{y}{x},\) so we have 
    \[\frac{1}{y} \di y = 3x^2 \di x \pd\]
    Integrating both sides (and writing one constant \(C\) on the right side) gives 
    \begin{equation} 
    \ln \abs y = x^3 + C \pd \label{eq:ex-C}
    \end{equation}
    Since the graph passes through the point \((1, 1),\)
    we substitute in \(\eqref{eq:ex-C}\) 
    this initial condition to solve for \(C \col\)
    \[\ln 1 = (1)^3 + C \implies C = -1 \pd\]
    Hence, \(\eqref{eq:ex-C}\) becomes
    \[
    \ln \abs y = x^3 - 1  
    \or \abs y = e^{x^3 - 1} \pd
    \]
    But since \(e^{x^3 - 1}\) is positive, \(\abs y = y\) and so
    our answer is
    \[\boxed{y = e^{x^3 - 1}}\]
    We could have solved for \(y\) in \(\eqref{eq:ex-C}\) before substituting the initial condition,
    but immediately solving for \(C\) is often easier.

    slope field for \(y' = 3x^2 y\) and the graph of the particular 
    solution \(y = e^{x^3 - 1}.\)
</div>

<p>
    Sometimes it's impossible to solve for \(y\) after we use Separation of Variables. 
    In these cases, we must write our solution as an implicit equation. 
    After we present the following topic, 
    the next example shows that solutions in implicit form may be useful sometimes.

    An important application of differential equations lies in finding an
    <span class="emph">orthogonal trajectory</span>—a curve 
    that intersects a family of curves <i>orthogonally</i>, that is, at right angles.
    (See <a href="#orthogonal-trajectory-graphs">Figure 3</a>.)
    In electrostatics, <i>equipotential curves</i> are perpendicular to 
    the lines of an electric field. 
    In thermodynamics, heat flows across a plane surface orthogonally to the <i>isothermal curves</i>.
    And in aerodynamics, the streamlines are orthogonal to the <i>velocity potential curves</i>.

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Orthogonal Trajectories to Circles</span>
    The family of circles \(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\) is fundamental to many applications. 
    By Implicit Differentiation, 
    the slope to the circle at any \((x, y)\) is \(\textderiv{y}{x} = -x/y.\)
    An orthogonal trajectory to this circle must be perpendicular to the circle's tangents, 
    so its slope at \((x, y)\) must be the negative reciprocal—that is, \(y/x.\) 
    The graph therefore satisfies the differential equation
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = \frac{y}{x} \pd\]
    Performing Separation of Variables, we attain 
    \[
    \ba 
    \int \frac{1}{y} \di y &= \int \frac{1}{x} \di x \nl 
    \ln \abs y &= \ln \abs x + C_1
    \ea 
    \]
    for any constant \(C_1.\)
    To solve for \(y,\) we exponentiate both sides using the base \(e.\)
    Letting \(m = \pm e^{C_1},\) we get 
    \[
    \ba
    \abs{y} &= e^{\ln \abs x + C_1} = e^{C_1} \abs x \nl 
    y &= \pm e^{C_1} x = mx \pd
    \ea
    \]
    Hence, a line that passes through the origin—the graph \(y = mx\)—with any slope \(m\) is an orthogonal trajectory
    to a circle centered at the origin, as shown by <a href="#orthogonal-trajectory-circle">Figure 4</a>.
    The circles and lines are therefore called <i>mutually orthogonal</i>.

    Using Implicit Differentiation on \(x = ky^2,\) we attain

    1 &= 2ky \deriv{y}{x} \nl 
    \implies \deriv{y}{x} &= \frac{1}{2ky} \pd
    \ea
    \]
    Let's eliminate \(k \col\)
    From the equation of the general parabola \(x = ky^2,\) we get \(k = x/y^2.\)
    So we have 
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = \frac{1}{2 \par{\dfrac{x}{y^2}} y} = \frac{y}{2x} \pd\]
    An orthogonal trajectory's slope at \((x, y)\) must be the negative reciprocal of \(y/2x.\) 
    Hence, the orthogonal trajectories satisfy the differential equation  
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = -\frac{2x}{y} \pd\]
    Using Separation of Variables, we find 
    \[
    \ba 
    \int y \di y &= \int -2x \di x \nl 
    \frac{y^2}{2} &= -x^2 + C \nl 
    \ea

    for any constant \(C.\)
    Let's rewrite this equation to be in the form 
    \[\boxed{x^2 + \frac{y^2}{2} = C}\]
    We intentionally wrote the solution as an implicit equation 
    to better recognize that it represents an ellipse.
    Hence, the orthogonal trajectories to \(x = ky^2\) are this family of ellipses,
    as shown by <a href="#orthogonal-trajectory-ellipses">Figure 5</a>.

<h4 id="mixing-problems">Mixing Problems</h4>
<p>
    First-order differential equations are powerful tools for modeling many situations;
    one of their applications involves problems with <i>mixing</i>. 
    In these problems, a tank contains some volume of liquid. 
    A solution with some concentration of dissolved solute, such as salt, enters the tank;
    at the same time, liquid flows out of the tank. 
    In this process, the solute in the tank changes continuously with time. 
    If \(y\) is the mass of solute in the tank and \(t\) is time, then 
    the rate of change of the solute is \(\textderiv{y}{t}.\)
    It is given by the <i>net rate</i> of solute flow—namely, 
    the rate at which solute enters the tank minus the rate at which solute leaves the tank. 
    We therefore write
    \begin{equation}
    \deriv{y}{t} = (\text{rate in}) - (\text{rate out}) \pd \label{eq:rate-mixing}
    \end{equation}
</p>

<div class="example-title"> EXAMPLE 4 </div>
<div class="example">
    <div class="example-problem">  
        A tank initially contains \(30\) kilograms of salt dissolved in \(3000\) liters 
        of water.
        A brine with a concentration of \(0.1\) kilogram of salt per liter of water  
        is pumped into the tank at a rate of \(20\) liters per minute. 
        The tank is drained so that it maintains a constant volume of \(3000\) liters. 
        How much salt remains in the tank after \(1\) hour?

    Let \(y(t)\) be the mass, in kilograms, of salt in the tank after \(t\) minutes. 
    Note that \(y(0) = 30;\) our goal is to find \(y(60).\)
    We model the salt in the tank using the differential equation given by \(\eqref{eq:rate-mixing},\)
    where we express \((\text{rate in})\) and \((\text{rate out})\) to be in kilograms per minute.
    The rate at which salt is pumped <i>in</i> is 
    \[\text{rate in} = \frac{0.1 \un{kg}}{1 \un{L}} \times \frac{20 \un{L}}{1 \un{min}} = 2 \, \frac{\un{kg}}{\un{min}} \pd\]
    Because the tank always contains \(3000 \un L\) of liquid,
    the concentration of salt at time \(t\) is \(y(t)/3000\) (whose units are kilograms per liter). 
    Liquid is drained at a rate to maintain the same volume, 
    so liquid <i>must exit the tank at the same rate</i> \(20 \undiv{L}{min}.\)
    Thus, the rate at which salt flows <i>out</i> is 
    \[\text{rate out} = \frac{20 \un{L}}{1 \un{min}} \times \frac{y(t) \un{kg}}{3000 \un{L}}  
    = \frac{y(t)}{150} \, \frac{\un{kg}}{\un{min}} \pd\]
    Hence, the differential equation becomes 
    \[
    \deriv{y}{t} = 2 - \frac{y(t)}{150} = \frac{300 - y(t)}{150} \pd
    \]
    We condense \(y(t)\) as \(y\) and perform Separation of Variables, as follows:
    \[
    \ba 
    \int \frac{\dd y}{300 - y} &= \int \frac{\dd t}{150} \nl 
    - \ln \abs{300 - y} &= \frac{t}{150} + C \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    Substituting the initial condition \(y(0) = 30\) shows 
    \[- \ln 270 = \frac{0}{150} + C \implies C = - \ln 270 \pd\]
    We therefore have
    \[
    \ba 
    -\ln \abs{300 - y} &= \frac{t}{150} - \ln 270 \nl 
    \abs{300 - y} &= 270 e^{-t/150} \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    Since \(y(0) = 30\) and the right-hand side is never negative, we 
    have \(\abs{300 - y}\) \(= 300 - y\) and so 
    \[
    \ba 
    300 - y &= 270 e^{-t/150} \nl 
    y &= 300 - 270 e^{-t/150} \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    So the mass of salt after \(1\) hour, or \(60\) minutes, is 
    \[y(60) = \boxed{300 - 270 e^{-60/150}} \approx 119.014 \un{kg} \pd\]
