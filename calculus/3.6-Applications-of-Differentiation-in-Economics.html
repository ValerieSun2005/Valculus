    Many customers are willing to purchase a new phone for \(\$100,\)
    but fewer are willing to pay \(\$900\) for the same phone.
    A manufacturer must therefore lower the phone's price to increase sales. 
    In general, as an item's price is raised, fewer consumers <i>demand</i> that product. 
    This inverse relationship between price and the number of units demanded 
    is called the <span class="emph">Law of Demand</span>.
    But how much should a product cost if a store wants to sell \(x\) units? 
    In economics, we use a <span class="emph">demand function</span> \(p(x)\) to model 
    the price per unit that a firm can charge 
    to sell \(x\) units. 
    Because revenue is the product of price and the number of units sold,
    a firm's <span class="emph">revenue function</span> is defined by 
    \begin{equation} 
    R(x) = x \, p(x) \pd \label{eq:revenue-R}
    \end{equation}
    For example, a movie theater's revenue could increase if ticket prices are raised 
    or if more tickets are sold.  
</p>

<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Cost Functions</span>
    To produce additional goods, a business must pay to expand. 
    For example, a small electronics chain may easily sell \(50\) phones per day;
    but to sell \(500\) phones per day, the store must extend its inventory, 
    hire additional employees, and pay for advertisementsâ€”thus incurring additional costs
    passed on to the phones' prices. 
    So a firm's <span class="emph">cost function</span> \(C(x),\)
    its cost to produce \(x\) units, 
    is usually increasing. 
    Then a firm's <span class="emph">profit function</span> is given by
    the difference between revenue and cost:
    \begin{equation} 
    P(x) = R(x) - C(x) \pd \label{eq:profit-P}
    \end{equation}
    A negative profit indicates that a firm is losing money.

<p>
    A firm's <span class="emph">average cost function</span>,
    the average cost per unit sold, is defined by 
    \begin{equation} 
    \overline C(x) = \frac{C(x)}{x} \pd \label{eq:avg-cost}
    \end{equation}
    We expect the graph of \(y = \overline C(x)\)
    to be concave up and have an absolute minimum
    (<a href="#business-avg-cost">Figure 1</a>).
    Initially, a firm incurs high startup costs (such as purchasing a store location), 
    resulting in a high average cost per unit sold.
    But this initial investment
    enables the firm to sell more units,
    so the average cost per unit begins decreasing. 
    Eventually, the firm reaches a point at which its resources are strained
    and must invest further to increase its capacity for production,
    such as by opening a new location.
    Consequently, as production continues to grow, the average cost increases.

<h4 id="margina-analysis">Marginal Analysis</h4>
<p>
    <i>Marginal analysis</i> explores a firm's additional gains or losses from producing one more unit. 
    Let's take the cost function \(C(x)\) to be differentiable.
    Even though \(x\) usually takes on integer values (to represent the number of goods sold),
    the differentiability assumption enables us to use calculus to attain useful results. 
    Suppose that the number of products sold increases from \(x_1\) to \(x_2,\)
    and let \(\Delta x = x_2 - x_1.\)
    Then the average rate of change of \(C\) on \([x_1, x_2]\) is 
    \[\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x} = \frac{C(x_2) - C(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{C(x_1 + \Delta x) - C(x_1)}{\Delta x} \pd\]
    Then the cost function's <i>instantaneous</i> rate of change at \(x_1\) is
    \[C'(x_1) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{C(x_1 + \Delta x) - C(x_1)}{\Delta x} \pd\]
    We call \(C'(x)\) the <span class="emph">marginal cost function</span>;
    it approximates the cost to produce one more unit.
    If a firm produces \(n\) units, then we estimate 
    \[C'(n) \approx \underbrace{C(n + 1) - C(n)}_{\text{cost of } (n + 1)\text{st unit}} \pd\]
    This approximation is especially accurate for large \(n.\)
    Using similar logic, we define the <span class="emph">marginal revenue function</span>
    to be \(R'(x)\) and the <span class="emph">marginal profit function</span> to be \(P'(x).\)
    If marginal profit is positive, then the firm should produce an extra unit.
    Yet if marginal profit is negative, 
    then the firm should <span class="warning">stop</span> expanding production to avoid further losses.

<div class="example-title"> EXAMPLE 2 </div>
<div class="example">
    <div class="example-problem">  
        A company's cost function is modeled by 
        \[C(x) = \tfrac{1}{6} x^3 + \tfrac{3}{40} x^2 + 6x + 20 \pd\]
        Its demand function is modeled by 
        \[p(x) = -\tfrac{1}{4} x^2 - x + 200 \pd\]
        Calculate the company's marginal cost, marginal revenue,
        and marginal profit 
        at the production level of \(10\) units.
    </div>
</div>
<button onclick="toggle2()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution2" class="solution">
    The marginal cost function is 
    \[C'(x) = \tfrac{1}{2} x^2 + \tfrac{3}{20} x + 6 \pd\]
    The marginal revenue function is 
    \[
    \ba 
    R'(x) &= \deriv{}{x} [x \, p(x)] \nl 
    &= \deriv{}{x} \par{-\tfrac{1}{4} x^3 - x^2 + 200x} \nl
    &= -\tfrac{3}{4} x^2 - 2x + 200 \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    At the production level of \(10\) units, \(x = 10,\)
    we see
    \[
    \ba 
    C'(10) &= \tfrac{1}{2} (10)^2 + \tfrac{3}{20} (10) + 6 
    = \boxed{\$57.50} \nl
    R'(10) &= -\tfrac{3}{4} (10)^2 - 2(10) + 200 = \boxed{\$105}
    \ea 
    \]
    Then the marginal profit is 
    \[
    \ba
    P'(10) &= R'(10) - C'(10) \nl 
    &= \$105 - \$57.50 = \boxed{\$47.50}
    \ea
    \]
    Since \(P'(10) \gt 0,\) the firm should produce the <nobr>\(11\)th</nobr> unit
    to gain approximately \(\$47.50.\)

    In the next examples, 
    we maximize firms' profits.
    See Section <a href="/Valculus/calculus/3.1-Minimum-and-Maximum-Values.html">3.1</a>
    to review the procedure of determining absolute maxima.
    In a competitive market with many buyers, 
    a business's demand function can often be approximated as constant,
    as shown by the following example. 
</p>

<div class="example-title"> EXAMPLE 3 </div>
<div class="example">
    <div class="example-problem">  
        Sydney operates a food truck in which she sells hot dogs for \(\$13\) each. 
        The cost, in dollars, of her producing \(x\) hot dogs per day is modeled by the function 
        \[C(x) = \tfrac{1}{20} x^2 + x + 300 \pd\]
        How many hot dogs per day should Sydney sell to maximize her profit?
    </div>
</div>
<button onclick="toggle3()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution3" class="solution">
    The demand function is a constant \(p(x) = 13,\)
    so the revenue function is \(R(x) = 13x.\)
    Then the profit function is, by \(\eqref{eq:profit-P},\)
    \[
    \ba 
    P(x) &= 13x - \par{\tfrac{1}{20} x^2 + x + 300} \nl 
    &= -\tfrac{1}{20} x^2 + 12x - 300 \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    To maximize \(P,\) we first determine its critical numbers by solving \(P'(x) = 0 \col\)
    \[
    \ba 
    P'(x) = - \tfrac{1}{10} x + 12 &= 0\nl 
    \implies x &= 120 \pd \nl
    \ea 
    \]
    The domain of \(P(x)\) in context is \(\{x \mid x \geq 0\}.\)
    For \(0 \leq x \lt 120,\) \(P' \gt 0;\) for \(x \gt 120,\) \(P' \lt 0.\) 
    By the First-Derivative Test, \(P\) has a <i>relative</i> maximum at \(x = 120.\) 
    Note that \(P(0) = -300,\) \(P(120) = 420,\) and \(\lim_{x \to \infty} P(x) = -\infty,\) 
    so \(P(x)\) has an <i>absolute</i> maximum at \(x = 120.\)
    Sydney therefore should sell \(\boxed{120}\) hot dogs per day to maximize her profit.

<div class="example-title"> EXAMPLE 4</div>
<div class="example">
    <div class="example-problem">  
        A beauty shop sells \(40\) eyeliner pencils per day if they are priced at \(\$10\) each.
        The manager predicts that the store will sell \(4\) fewer pencils 
        for every \(\$2\) increase in their price.
        How much should the shop raise the price of its eyeliner pencils to maximize revenue?
    </div>
</div>
<button onclick="toggle4()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution4" class="solution">
    Let \(s\) be the number of dollars by which the store raises the price of eyeliner pencils. 
    Then the price is \((10 + 2s)\) and the quantity is \((40 - 4s).\)
    So the revenue function is
    \[
    \ba 
    R(s) &= (40 - 4s)(10 + 2s) \nl
    &= -8s^2 + 40s + 400 \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    To maximize \(R,\) we first seek its critical numbers. 
    Solving \(R'(s) = 0\) shows
    \[
    \ba 
    R'(s) = -16s + 40 &= 0 \nl
    \implies s &= \tfrac{40}{16} = 2.5 \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    For \(s \lt 2.5,\) \(R' \gt 0;\) for \(s \gt 2.5,\) \(R' \lt 0.\) 
    Thus, the First-Derivative Test states that \(s = 2.5\) 
    corresponds to a <i>relative</i> maximum of \(R(s).\)
    The domain of \(R(s)\) in context is \(\{s \mid s \geq 0\};\)
    note that \(R(0) = 400,\) \(R(2.5) = 450,\)
    and \(\lim_{s \to \infty} R(s) = -\infty.\) 
    Accordingly, \(s = 2.5\) is the location of the <i>absolute</i> maximum of \(R(s).\) 
    The store should raise the price of the eyeliner pencil by \(\boxed{\$2.50}.\)
