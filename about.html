    This website is centered around a free, online single-variable calculus textbook 
    with complete sections and thousands of exercises. 
    My motivation was simple—to allow students to witness the beauty of calculus, 
    <i>for free</i>. 
    Alternatively, struggling students value the breadth of topics in this text; 
    with thousands of full solutions to exercises, ValCalc serves as an excellent supplemental resource 
    for both students and instructors.

    For years, I've been working on using web design to best teach calculus.
    Since all the content is digital, 
    cross-referencing is easier than ever: 
    Referenced sections, headings, examples, and figures appear as hyperlinks—to be accessed in one click, 
    with no more flipping pages.
    (For example, <q>See Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/5.5-Work.html">5.5</a>.</q>)
    Some sections contain animations, which a printed book could never accomplish. 
    Concepts such as tangent lines, definite integrals, and arc length can only be feasibly 
    taught by using animations. 
    One of my favorite animations is <a href="#disks-volume">Animation 1</a>, 
    which shows how a solid of revolution can be approximated by many thin disks. 
    (This animation appears in Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/5.3-Solids-of-Revolution.html">5.3</a>.)
</p>

    Calculus is fundamental to the sciences, engineering, and economics. 
    To show these connections, I have placed applications in most of the sections, 
    either in the main text or in the exercises. 
    I am proud of Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/8.3-Exponential-Models.html">8.3</a>, 
    which applies exponential models to compound interest, radioactive dating,
    chemical reactions, cooling hot objects, and discharging a capacitor—satisfying the thirst among 
    curious students. 
    With modern case studies, these sections enrich a student's learning experience 
    and drill in calculus for long-term memory. 
    For example, I showed how logistic models (and their otherwise mundane properties) enable us to model diseases, such as smallpox 
    and COVID-19, in Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/8.4-Logistic-Models.html">8.4</a>.
    In each section, I aim to rectify common mistakes students commit, 
    such as believing the Product Rule is \((fg)' \ne f' g'.\)
    But I also provide tips in each section; 
    by taking these to heart, students perform computations more efficiently.
    Each chapter concludes with a set of review exercises, 
    a set of about 40–60 multiple-choice questions 
    that cover each section in the chapter. 
    (My goal was to make these multiple-choice questions similar to the sections' exercises.)
    I suggest that a student print out these exercises and use them as a practice exam; 
    doing so will allow the student to pinpoint any problem areas. 
</p>
<p>
    No two instructors agree on how best to teach calculus. 
    For every instructor who praises my order of sections, 
    another vehemently disagrees with the sequence. 
    For example, students have a very difficult time understanding polar and parametric functions.
    Other authors place the topics of differentiating polar functions and
    finding areas bounded by polar curves into one section—I disagree with this idea.
    Rather than cramming these difficult ideas into one section, 
    I have separate sections for differentiating polar functions 
    (Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/9.5-Differentiating-Polar-Functions.html">9.5</a>)
    and finding areas bounded by polar curves 
    (Section <a href="/ValCalc/ValCalc/calculus/9.6-Areas-with-Polar-Curves.html">9.6</a>). 
    In each section, I provide many examples and fully cover the nuances of these processes—so 
    that the student can absorb these topics the first time. 
    Ultimately, these disagreements are rooted in a good cause—to help students best learn calculus.
