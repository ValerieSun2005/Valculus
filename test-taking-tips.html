    An exam is designed to assess your knowledge of course content. 
    A calculus exam is special—it requires you to think for yourself, 
    and memorization isn't enough.   
    But what if you're not seeing the results you want despite your dedicated efforts?
    Do you believe that you're proficient in a topic, but it wasn't reflected by your exam grade?
    We have compiled a list of tips to help you navigate this hurdle. 
</p>
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Preparing for the Exam</span>
    We recommend that <i>all students stop cramming</i>. 
    Sometimes it's inevitable; when life gets in the way, 
    we can feel overwhelmed and put off an important task. 
    But procrastinating is not a strategy; 
    this is particularly true for math courses, 
    in which students are expected to solve problems by themselves. 
    (You cannot feasibly learn an entire month's worth of math content in a few days.)
    Instead, space out your studying: 
    <ul>
        <li>
            Do all the homework as soon as it is assigned.
            Later, redo these problems; they'll let you gauge how hard the exam questions are.
        </li>
        <li>
            Review your notes, and get extra help if necessary. 
            (Go to your instructor's office hours or study with a friend.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Complete some extra exercises and a few practice exams; 
            doing so allows you to target any holes in your understanding. 
            And instead of staring at the solution manual, 
            be sure you can produce the work yourself. 
            Math isn't a spectator sport—you must learn by participating, 
            just as you can't learn sports by merely watching others play.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">Immediately before the Exam</span>
    The night before the exam can be stressful.
    We suggest that you do the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Set a reminder so that the exam time is drilled in your mind. 
            Prepare all the materials you need for your exam—for example, 
            a pen or pencil, an eraser, a water bottle, scratch paper, your student identification card, 
            and (if allowed) a fully charged calculator.
            Pack these materials in your bag ahead of time to minimize any delays.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you've studied well throughout the semester, 
            then now is your time to relax—you've done all you could.
            It's a good idea to take the night off—do something fun, such as 
            watching a movie or going out with friends.
        </li>
        <li>
            Get moral support from your friends! 
            They'll be rooting for you, even from outside the exam room.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sleep well. 
            You'll find that math is much easier with a sharp mind. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    After having a good night's sleep, 
    <i>eat breakfast</i>, 
    especially if your exam is in the morning.
    Or if the exam is during the evening, then eat dinner beforehand.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">During the Exam</span>
    Skim through the entire exam to gauge its difficulty. 
    After noting the tricky areas, begin with the easiest questions. 
    Imagine you're playing a video game—you want to earn as many points as possible, 
    so start by securing the easy ones. 
    And by beginning light, you're warming yourself up 
    to tackle the difficult problems later on.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Work as quickly as you can without losing accuracy; 
            ideally, you should know how long to spend on each question.
        </li>
        <li>
            Show all your work, because instructors assign partial credit even if your answer is wrong
            (or zero credit if you get the right answer without supporting work).
        </li>
        <li>
            Instead of erasing, simply scratch out any wrong work: 
            not only does erasing waste your time, 
            but you could be destroying work that you soon realize was correct.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you're stuck on a question, then <i>move on</i>.
            Don't spend more than a few minutes staring at the page. 
            With enough distancing, you might just get the spark that allows you to compute that integral.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take deep breaths:
            If you still can't figure out that problem, then take a deep breath—the others around you 
            also have the same difficult integral.
            Remind yourself that <i>you know calculus</i>; you've worked all semester for this moment. 
            Trust your intuition—it's more trustworthy than you think.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="label-emph">After the Exam</span>
    How confident did you feel about that exam? 
    After the exam concludes, discussing answers with other students (if permitted) 
    could propel you with confidence—or destroy any hope you had.
    Through conversing, you may learn that you made a silly error (or did a problem completely wrong) and be angry at yourself. 
    So think twice before you engage in discussion, 
    and respect your peers' decisions if they choose not to engage.
    Regardless of how you feel, treat yourself! 
    For weeks you've worked hard to prepare for this day; 
    you can now (hopefully) enjoy a nice afternoon to yourself—grab some pizza, 
    take a nap, or go to a lively social event.
    It's important to take care of yourself—because <i>mental health matters</i>, 
    and your well-being is always more important than one exam grade.
